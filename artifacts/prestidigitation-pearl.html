<p>Prestidigitation Pearls glow with a magickal energy, the color of which varies from manufacturer to manufacturer. These pearls allow for a one-time use of the Prestidigitation spell by those with no innate magickal talents. The spell's effects are most often utilized as quick cleaning options, and a bowl of pearls is often found in the washrooms of many of the more ‘well to do’ households.</p>
