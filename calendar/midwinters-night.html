<p>Midwinter's Night on the 14th of Frostmoot is celebrated as a halfway point between the winter solstice and the spring equinox. It is a time of hope and renewal, when the days are slowly getting longer and the harshness of winter begins to subside. It is a time for feasting, storytelling, and sharing warmth and companionship with loved ones, as people look forward to the coming of spring and the renewal of life. The holiday also has roots in ancient NÃ©eark folklore, with tales of the spirits of winter and the struggle between darkness and light.</p>
