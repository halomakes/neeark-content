<h1>The Creatures of Néeark</h1>
<p>Néeark is home to a vast variety of creatures, both docile and deadly. During their travels the Hunters of Kyria Pol have begun to document those that they come across in their travels. What is found below is just a small sampling of the beings called home by Néeark.</p>
<h2>Monsters</h2>
<p>Monsters are said to have existed in Néeark as long as life has existed in Néeark. They are simultaneously the cause of much death and destruction and the reason for the advancements in comfort and security that the citizens of Néeark have enjoyed.</p>
<p>It's important to note that while the abilities granted by monster parts are powerful, they are not without risk. Inexperienced or untrained individuals attempting to use these enhanced items can easily injure or even kill themselves in the process.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the acquisition of these parts is often a dangerous endeavor, requiring skilled Hunters to track down and take down the monsters. This has led to a thriving industry centered around the procurement and sale of monster parts, with many specialized shops and markets located throughout Néeark.</p>
<p>Despite the risks, the allure of enhanced abilities has driven many to seek out these monster parts, and the use of them has become ubiquitous throughout Néeark. From the humblest of farmers to the most powerful of kingdoms, the use of monster parts has become an integral part of life in this world.</p>
