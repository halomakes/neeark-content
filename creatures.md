# The Creatures of Néeark
Néeark is home to a vast variety of creatures, both docile and deadly. During their travels the Hunters of Kyria Pol have begun to document those that they come across in their travels. What is found below is just a small sampling of the beings called home by Néeark.

## Monsters
Monsters are said to have existed in Néeark as long as life has existed in Néeark. They are simultaneously the cause of much death and destruction and the reason for the advancements in comfort and security that the citizens of Néeark have enjoyed.
