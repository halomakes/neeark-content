<p>Abyssal Lagiacrus was a rare sub-species of the Lagiacrus which are sometimes found within freshwater to saltwater tributaries. An Abyssal Lagiacrus was responsible for the destruction of Clearwater, an early Human settlement in south-east Priodomus. This would however lead the the creation of <a href="../locations/fallwind">Fallwind</a>.</p>

<h3>Physiology</h3>
<p>Its shell is a lustrous black, and, unlike its cousins, it is bio-luminescent. As such, its body is covered in vivid blue points of light, a color matched by its electricity-producing dorsal spikes and hood spines. Its eyes are a striking red that appear to glow among the murky depths, and the inside of its mouth is a vivid electric blue. The horns and spines on its head and upper neck are longer and more prominent than the other species of Lagiacrus.</p>
<h3>Abilities</h3>
<p>It appears to always be in a fully charged state, with all of its spikes constantly glowing at maximum power. It can fire electrical blasts from its mouth that send pulses of electricity everywhere, very much like the blast of Ivory Lagiacrus. Abyssal Lagiacrus is unique among its brethren in that it is known to use the motions of its serpentine body to create underwater whirlpools that can disorient hunters and set them up for a devastating blow.</p>
<h3>Habitat</h3>
<p>The Abyssal Lagiacrus variant has only been seen once, in the specimen which destroyed Fallwind. It is unclear to Scholars what prompted this mutation, and it has not been seen since. The Lagiacrus of Lake Mimm Jakar have been intensely studied in the subsequent years, with no clear explanation found as of yet, thought by the Hunt's own admission, the depths of Lake Mimm Jakar cannot be thoroughly scoured.</p>
