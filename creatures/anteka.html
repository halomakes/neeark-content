<p>Anteka are greatly adapted for life in the cold. They have long legs with thick, cloven hooves, excellent for bursts of speed as well as keeping the creature from sinking in the snow. Anteka also have thick, wooly fur that shields it from the frigid mountain air. Anteka are known for their large horns. They are present in both genders.</p>
