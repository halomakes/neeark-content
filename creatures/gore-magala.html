<p>Gore Magala is a very unique wyvern, sharing traits and similarities to that of the Elder Dragons, possessing six limbs, including the clawed wings on its back. Though, its overall appearance and stance resembles a quadrupedal wyvern like the Nargacuga. Its body is covered in dark exoskeleton plates, with notable features including the hidden feelers that are folded alongside its face, the lack of visible eyes and fanged jaws that are actually parts of its external armor plates. The other unique part is its wings, which are covered in jet-black fur that resemble a tattered and ragged cape. The claws on its wings are extremely prehensile, and even seem to possess opposable thumbs. They are used for grabbing, helping with running and maintaining stability. When not engaged in combat, Gore Magala tends to cloak its body with its wings by latching them onto its back.</p>
<p>Gore Magala has an unusually high metabolism but rarely feeds on much prey. Due to this metabolism, its hairs on its wings are constantly left behind and flying in the air. These hairs are used to understand their environment and leave behind a trail that Gore Magala uses to see both predators and prey by heat. Once it smells something in the area, it will begin to spread its hairs around the area in order to find the target and these hairs will attach onto the target, allowing the Gore Magala to see them with heat. As Gore Magala's senses increase and become better from these hairs, its color under its wings will slowly change and get brighter. When its senses are at their highest peak, two antennae will appear from its head and it will release large amounts of hairs into the air. The hairs in the sky will darken the sky as if an eclipse was in the area and it will begin to walk on all six. This is its Frenzy State. When it enters this state, it will begin to use its wing claws to allow it to walk and attack better using them. These claws can leave deep gouges in prey that are said to never heal.</p>
<h3><strong>Frenzy Virus</strong></h3>
<p><strong>The Frenzy Virus</strong> is an infectious disease caused by the attacks and breath weapons of Gore Magala and Shagaru Magala, affecting both sentient races and monsters alike.</p>
<h5><strong>Signs and Symptoms</strong></h5>
<p>In large creatures, the Frenzy Virus causes a notable discoloration of the skin, fur, feathers, or hide, resulting in a dark purple hue all over the body. In addition, the monster's eyes will become a bright red and it will begin to huff a dark purple smoke from its mouth as it exhales. The Frenzy Virus causes massively heightened aggression, speed, and strength in monsters, making them dangerously short-tempered and ferocious. The Frenzy Virus also seems to affect a monster's vocal cords, rendering all vocalizations shrill and harsh.</p>
<p>In sentient races, the Frenzy Virus effects are significantly different. Once infected, a person will experience a nullification of their natural healing abilities, making it impossible to recover health without the aid of magic. They additionally receive more damage from a frenzied monster's attacks and lose any absorption, immunity, or resistance they may have. They do gain some benefits while under the effects of the frenzied virus, their ferocity increases making it more likely to deal critical damage to a creature in addition to increasing the damage they would normally cause.</p>
