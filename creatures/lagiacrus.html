<p>The Lagiacrus is one of the most famous and feared Leviathan. A large water monster It sits comfortably at the top of the oceanic food chain. It is the top predator of its habitat, and even predators such as Rathalos and Rathian prefer to keep out of its way. Of course being the Lagiacrus' only real competition besides each other, the Fire Wyverns would be considered a threat to a Lagiacrus, as would a Lagiacrus to a Fire Wyvern. Lagiacrus's control of Thunder Element makes it a dangerous adversary in the aquatic habitat it resides, even for the well defended Gobul. Even Plesioth that migrate to tropical islands and flooded forests would be wary of the large and powerful leviathan as its powerful electrical attacks can easily cripple or even kill the Piscine Wyvern. This would cause Plesioth to avoid Lagiacrus at all costs. Lagiacrus are known to feed on fish, lobsters, Kelbi, Aptonoth, and Epioth.</p>
<p>Lagiacrus are highly aggressive Leviathans that are the "Lord of the Sea". To hunt down and capture prey, Lagiacrus will swim in a circle to form a whirlpool. These whirlpools are used to suck up fish and other prey so Lagiacrus can shock them to death before feeding on their quarry. These whirlpools are occasionally used to sink boats and ships.</p>
<p>Lagiacrus is a large, blue aquatic leviathan , adapted to life in tropical waters. When a Lagiacrus is fully sunbathed, it turns a dry grayish-blue color and its dermal spikes turn a pale red. When it returns to the water, Lagiacrus regains a striking deep blue color and its spikes return to their original color of a very light beige.</p>
<p>Its hood-like structure allows it to swim through the water much quicker along with the help of its tail and limbs. Lagiacrus are able to stay submerged underwater for up to half a day without coming out for air. The large dorsal spikes on its back are used to release its electric attacks alongside a possible electro sac below each spike. It's able to release this electricity by contracting its cells at high speeds inside its muscles. When it does this some of the electricity actually combines with some of the mucus in its mouth, allowing it to spit out lightning projectiles from its mouth. In other regions, the Lagiacrus is able to bend the lightning it creates around it, how it does this is still unknown. It is known to come ashore to regain its strength after discharging or to rest when it's tired.</p>
