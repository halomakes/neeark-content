<p>The Nightshade Paolumu body is covered in soft fur that is primarily black or dark purple, contrasting with its standard counterpart's white-and-pink coloration. Its tail is also darkly colored, matching the color of its fur. Its face is pale white, while on its neck are two brightly colored patches resembling the patterns on the tail feathers of a peacock. When it is deflated, these patches are more difficult to see. Its wings contain faint hints of green on the webbing.</p>
<p>Nightshade Paolumu is far more aggressive and proficient in aerial combat than Paolumu. Whereas Paolumu requires several attempts to suck enough air into its throat sac to get airborne, Nightshade Paolumu is able to inflate itself with a single inhalation. Once airborne, it is capable of flying at high speeds and in unpredictable patterns by releasing its stored air, often dealing damage to hunters that are hit.</p>
<p>Its most distinctive ability is a pale blue-green gas it expels from its mouth while inflated, which acts as a powerful narcotic that puts to sleep hunters that are exposed. It's able to produce small clouds or exhale a single, massive cloud, which remains on the battlefield for a short duration. It can inhale without inflating itself in order to draw in patches of its gas, and it can spread them out using the wind currents it stirs up with its tail.</p>
