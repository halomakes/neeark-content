<p>Zinogre is a quadrupedal monster that is very wolf-like if one looks at its face, and has a very muscular set of forelimbs - very comparable to those of big cats. It has surprising agility for such a large monster, similar to nargacuga. It has sharp claws attached to strong muscular fore-limbs, which are used to deliver a fatal blow to prey and hunters. It also helps them to climb mountains and rocky terrain. The spikes on its body mostly lie flat, but when it has built up an electric charge they stick out vertically into the air.</p>
<p>The Zinogre can also harness the power of electricity, much like a lagiacrus, using it to take down larger prey and to defend itself and its territory. Thunderbugs are seen gathering around zinogre when it is "charging" electricity; they may act as a source of energy. As Zinogre preys on Gargwa, Thunderbugs become safe, simply by flying around in close proximity to a Zinogre. Zinogre can exploit this by absorbing the energy emitted by the bugs during battle, granting it special abilities. Thunderbugs might glow blue</p>
