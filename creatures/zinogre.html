<p>Zinogre is a quadrupedal monster that is very wolf-like if one looks at its face, and has a very muscular set of forelimbs - very comparable to those of big cats. It has surprising agility for such a large monster, similar to <a href="/creatures/nargacuga">Nargacuga</a>. It has sharp claws attached to strong muscular fore-limbs, which are used to deliver a fatal blow to prey and hunters. It also helps them to climb mountains and rocky terrain. The spikes on its body mostly lie flat, but when it has built up an electric charge they stick out vertically into the air.</p>
<p>The Zinogre can also harness the power of electricity, much like a <a href="/creatures/lagiacrus">Lagiacrus</a>, using it to take down larger prey and to defend itself and its territory. Thunderbugs are seen gathering around zinogre when it is "charging" electricity; they may act as a source of energy. As Zinogre preys on Gargwa, Thunderbugs become safe, simply by flying around in close proximity to a Zinogre. Zinogre can exploit this by absorbing the energy emitted by the bugs during battle, granting it special abilities. Thunderbugs might glow blue instead of their normal colour to indicate that they have allied with a Zinogre.If you look close at a Zinogre, you can see an energy field around it. Juvenile Zinogre have more hair on their bodies compared to adults and is white in color. It is believed that the increased hair protects the juvenile's shell and helps speed up the storage of electricity. This fur will shed as the juvenile Zinogre matures into adulthood.</p>
<p>Zinogre are somewhat similar to real wolves, they even howl like them. But they do not form packs, quite the contrary, they are solitary hunters. This is no surprise, since they are extremely powerful and agile monsters, not needing teamwork to take down prey. According to eyewitnesses, adult Zinogre make herds and raise their young. During this period of time it is ill-advised to go hunting Zinogre as the adults will aggressively attack any intruders getting too close to their offspring.</p>
