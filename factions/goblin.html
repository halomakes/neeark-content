<p>The Goblins of Néeark have a very tribal and secluded life-style in comparison to the other sentient species of Néeark. Easily as intelligent as most other species, the majority of Goblins nevertheless refuse to follow in the steps of their more "civilized" counterparts. Their homes and temples are built of wood, stone, and bone, and they rely on walls and secluded locations to avoid becoming a mid-day snack for a passing Rathalos.</p>
<p>Most Goblins have a close relationship with one or more of the Goblin deities, with each Goblin city constantly competing to build the best temple to their chosen deities. In so doing, instead of demolishing an old temple and building a new one at the same site, they simply build over the old structure. This has led to immense, well-proportioned, and beautifully decorated temples at the heart of most Goblin cities.</p>
<p>Néearkian Goblins have a caste-like social organization, with movement between the castes requiring prowess in warfare, gaining more power as they kill more Monsters, securing vital parts for the tribe. Piplitin (pip-LIH-tin) are considered the Nobles of Goblin culture, usually limited to Military Leaders and High-ranking Clerics. The second class: Macehualli (MAHK-hwall-ee) serve as workers, artisans, and warriors, serving as a majority of Goblin society.</p>
<p>Finally, the Tlacotin (LA-coat-in) consists primarily of slaves, farmers, and other menial laborers. All goblins, regardless of gender or caste, are able to enlist in the military, serving while being given an opportunity to gain rank within the Goblin castes. Soldiers are able to obtain privileges similar to those of the Piplitin by demonstrating prowess in warfare. When a warrior takes a captive they accrue the right to use certain emblems, weapons or garments, and as they takes more captives their rank and prestige increase.</p>
