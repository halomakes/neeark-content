<p>Orcs were one of the races created by <a href="/religions#the-munravatu">the Munravatu</a> alongside the other sentient creatures of Néeark. Home to the harsh climes of the Isles of Mneveth and the Eriyum Marsh, this race quickly developed a society to match. Little of Orc culture is still known, as they were driven to extinction during the early years of the <a href="/calendar#age-of-bone">Age of Bone</a>, though some evidence of their culture has been found by recent Archeological excavations by Dragonborn in the region.</p>

<p>&nbsp;What is known of Orc culture is that they valued martial prowess above most other forms of achievement, with the vast majority of their resources being dedicated to these endeavors. Orcs rivaled the early Hunters in their capacity for survival within Néeark, quickly building well defended tribal camps from the remains of their kills.</p>
<p>Orcs developed advanced tactics for felling various Monsters, with some accounts crediting Orcs with teaching early Humans, Elves, and Dwarves how to utilize Monster parts for weapons and armor. Additionally, the use of a mythical metal, known as Ekhû allowed for the creation of incredibly durable tools of war.</p>
<p>This martial prowess however, soon led to the development of a “might-makes-right” system of law, and resulted in the only known large-scale armed conflict between the sentient species of Néeark. This conflict, known as the Motahl Wôr lasted for several years, and was waged primarily between the Orcs and the Dragonborn, however, many Human, Elf, and Dwarven mercenaries were believed to have joined the Dragonborn based on archeological records.</p>
<h2>Ekhû</h2>
<p>The mythical metal called Ekhû (taken from ancient Dragonborn texts pertaining to the Motahl Wôr) has stumped metallurgists in the Age of Steel since it was forst discovered worn by ancient Orc soldiers found in the southern region of the Eriyum Marsh. Stronger than any known metal, with properties that baffle even the most devout Orciologist, Ekhû weaponry was peerless according to archeological reports.</p>
<p>When identifying spells are used, unknown enchantments are shown to have shaped the material, with the composition being uniform throughought all Ekhû weapon pieces. The material however, cannot be smelted or reshaped by any known metal working methods.</p>
