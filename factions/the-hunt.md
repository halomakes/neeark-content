Brimming with the best and brightest individuals in the nation, The Hunt is home to those with the strength and resolve to stand toe to toe against the creatures that roam the wilds of Néeark:  Scholars, Alchemists, Wizards, and, of course, Hunters. The Hunt's presence exists nearly everywhere, the demand for Hunters is ubiquitous across Néeark. There is very little The Hunt will not take on, provided the coin is good and the job dangerous enough.

The Hunt is headquarted in [Kyria Pol](/locations/kyria-pol) in a building called the Lodge.  It is currently led by Hunt Mistress [Amadis Teryl](/people/amadis-teryl).

## Hunting Parties
Hunters who have graduated are free to choose their own hunting parties, with parties ranging from as few as 2, to as many as 12 Hunters. These Hunting Parties are often dynamic, evolving over time, with a few in particular existing long enough to be considered "Legacy", bringing in new Hunters as the old members retire or are retired.

#### Legacy Hunting Parties
- The 'Kyria Pol Dozen'
- The Hipshots
- Hero's Tribute
- The 'Merciful End'
- The Culmination
- Last Rites
