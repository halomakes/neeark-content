<p>Néeark is a world that some say will never be tamed. Despite the prevalence of magic in every-day life, refined into common goods that all but the poorest have had at least some exposure to, the creatures that roam the globe combined with the sometimes devestating effects of strong ley-line currents have left civilizations scattered and dense. Settlements are rare and expensive, with none but the most venturous of investors putting down the coin needed to pay for the guards required to keep the wilds at bay.</p>

<h3>Authoring</h3>
<p>Please take care when editing content on this wiki. URLs should be formatted according to the structure in place, with singular names for pages that are not expected to have children and plural names for pages that will contain a list of sub-pages. Moving/renaming pages is a bit of a pain, so please put thought into conventions before creating a new one.</p>
<p>If you'd like access to edit, please send your email to halomademeapc#8204 on Discord and I will get you set up.</p>
<p>Some of these pages still use markdown for formatting. If you aren't familiar with it you can use <a href="https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#html">this cheatsheet on GitHub</a> to get started. The editor will also accept raw HTML but I would discourage using it too much. When creating new pages, please use the WYSIWYG editor.</p>
