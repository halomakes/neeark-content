<h2 class="toc-header" id="overview"> Overview</h2>
<p>The land of Néeark is comprised primarily of two continents, separated by two main seas: The Platinum Sea and the Northern Tides. To the West, the continent of Ineon hosts Daso, a massive forest said to nearly meld with the Feywild in many places. To the East, the continent of Priodomus houses the majority of the human population.</p>

<h2 class="toc-header" id="eras"> Eras</h2>
<p>The history of Néeark is divided into two eras.</p>
<h3 class="toc-header" id="age-of-bone"> Age of Bone</h3>
<p>The actual number of years attributed to the age of Bone varies from culture to culture and account to account. Some Scholars have written several dozen yards of parchment expounding on why, in their professional opinion, the Age of Bone cannot be more than 2,000 years old. However, there are Elves who claim to be entering their fourth century of life, though these claims are seldom verifiable past the last thousand or so years.</p>
<p>What is known is that during the Age of Bone, the three "Elder" species of Néeark, the Humans, Dwarves, and Elves, fought tooth, nail, and borrowed claw for their place in the world.</p>
<h3 class="toc-header" id="age-of-steel"> Age of Steel</h3>
<p>Scholars have decided on the date that the first Elder Dragon attack against Kyria Pol was successfully repelled as the beginning of the Age of Steel. The reasoning behind this, per the official statement of the Hunt scholars, is that this marked the beginning of the cities, the walls of which protected its citizens with a certainty never before achieved. The Hunt had successfully tamed a few small cities across Priodomus. Their ambitions soon extending even across the Platinum Sea...</p>
