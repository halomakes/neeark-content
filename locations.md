## Overview
The land of Néeark is comprised primarily of two continents, separated by two main seas: The Platinum Sea and the Northern Tides.

However, there are Elves who claim to be entering their fourth century of life, though these claims are seldom verifiable past the last thousand or so years.

What is known is that during the Age of Bone, the three "Elder" species of Néeark, the Humans, Dwarves, and Elves, fought tooth, nail, and borrowed claw for their place in the world.

### Age of Steel
Scholars have decided on the date that the first Elder Dragon attack against Kyria Pol was successfully repelled as the beginning of the Age of Steel.
