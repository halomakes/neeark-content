Cloudcairn is one of the three largest cities in NÃ©eark, perched atop a large plateau on the eastern continent near the [Voiceless Steppe](/locations/voiceless-steppe). Cloudcairne was one of the first major "Projects" funded by a Dragonborn with coin to burn nearly 350 years ago. The largest expenses came from clearing Cloud Plateau of the many powerful creatures that called it their home. Some accounts seem point to a large tribe of [Cloud Giants](/creatures/cloud-giant), however, this tale is adamantly rejected by Cloudcairne's leadership, insisting that no intelligent species called the plateau its home prior to the construction of the city; official records cite a herd of [Kirin](/creatures/kirin) as the primary obstacle.

Its position at the top of a sheer cliff with a single colossal winding staircase gives it an incredibly powerful defensive advantage, allowing the city to focus its defense primarily on airborne threats. Cloucairne was designed such that no flying creature, be it a [Wingdrake](/creatures/wingdrake) or a [Dragon](/creatures/dragon), would persist in an attack against the city. Magical ballista encircle the city, firing large iron projectiles at supersonic speeds, and rumors abound about an invisible magical dome protecting the city, though it has not been activated sinve its cunstruction.

This was not, however, always the case, as an attack thirty years ago by a Kushala Daora was fended off by a cadre of Hunters. During the attack, all but two of the Hunters were gravely injured or killed. These two Hunters managed to bring down the Kushala, saving the lives of several thousand citizens, and bearing fruits in the form of the first Airship.

Cloudcairne is naturally home to the world's first [Airship](/artifacts/airship) Docks, being the home of the vessels invention. It recently christened the 21st Airship ever constructed, a commission by the Mistress of the Hunt herself. Housing a new, larger engine, rumored to be powered by an engine incorporation parts from a powerful Elder Dragon, this ship can travel farther faster, with protection and amenities boasted by no other vessel owned, private or public.

Despite Kyria Pol's center of Magickal innovation, Cloudcairne has solidified itself as the center of research and development in new [Machines](/artifacts/machines). While magick still turns the gears for many of these contraptions, the goal of Machines has often been to reduce the "free will" component prevalent in many Magickal constructs. Alchemy is common here, and the first [Guns](/artifacts/weapons/firearm) were produced by a Gnomish Tinkerer named Erhim in a tiny shop deep in the heart of Cloudcairne.

Being a fairly new, but fast growing city, Cloudcairne is home to the majority of the factories that are becoming more common in recent years. [Magick](/abilities/magick) and technology are nearly synonymous here, with Master Wizards working to deconstruct the magicks they wield, and many Apprentices working on magickal item "construction lines", producing [Prestidigitation Pearls](/artifacts/prestidigitation-pearl), [Minor Illusion Arm-bands](/artifacts/illusion-arm-band), [Light Wands](/artifacts/light-wand), and more for public consumption.
