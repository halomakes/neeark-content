## Overview
Fallwind is a large town situated on the north-eastern shores of Lake Mimm Jakr. Originally two adjacent towns: the Dwarven mining-city of Hrutvan established during the late years of the Age of Bone, and the Human settlement of Clearwater established in 63 AS. The two towns existed in a cautious, but calm peace, with the fisherman and farmers of Clearwater providing food and raw materials to Hrutvan, receiving metal tools, artisan goods, and strong building materials from Hrutvan.

\[Redacted\] years ago, however, the town of Clearwater was attacked by an [Abyssal Lagiacrus](/locations/fallwind/*), with the four Hunters tasked with protecting the town falling during its initial defense. Hurt, but alive and enraged, the Monster tore through the city in a rampage, destroying the town.

Not content to look on while their Human friends fell to the creature, the Dwarves of Hrutvan charged to the defense of the survivers fleeing north, placing themselves firmly between the humans and the enraged Lagiacrus. With a battlecry of "Rir avok kyn!" ("For our Kin!") the Dwarves engaged the Lagiracus, with the killing blow being dealt by the very Dwarf who initially called for his bretheren to help the Humans.

Thanks to the intervention of the Dwarves of Hrutvan, 438 lives were saved, including 93 survivers found within the wreckage of the town of Clearwater. The Dwarves, invoking the rite of "Kyn mea olji blod" (translated literally: Kin by lost blood) provided shelter for the Humans, with the city deciding upon a new name: Fallwind, to commemorate the lost lives, but the strengthened bonds between the two towns.

## Economy
Fallwind, like many cities established early on, is fairly self-sufficient by requirement, however, there is demand within Priodomus for a few goods specific to Fallwind.

Due to the unique history of Fallwind, its fishing supplies are considered to be the best by a wide margin, with towns as far away as Steelhold paying good coin for Fallwind fishing gear.

Additionally, several species of fish and marine life are home only to Lake Mimm Jakr, with a set number of licenses going out each year, almost always exclusively to the established fishing families of Fallwind.

The Hrutvan mines are still active, with tunnels stretching wide and deep within the Taivan range providing access to metals and precious gems.
