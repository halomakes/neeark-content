Kyria Pol is a city located on the western coast of the eastern continent, Priodomus.

It is the unofficial "Capitol" of the world, hosting just over three hundred thousand souls. It is also the Cultural driving force within NÃ©eark. Every sentient race is represented here, and opportunity to prosper abounds, however, one man's windfall is usually another's bankruptcy. The amount of coin that runs through Kyria Pol in a day is enough to make even the most ancient dragon jealous.

The main source and consumer of this coin is [The Hunt](/factions/the-hunt), around which Kyria Pol was built. Hunters have served since ancient times as both defenders and creators of civilization. The Hunt is home to scholars and warriors, blacksmiths and artificers, leaders and soldiers, and everything in between. At the beginning, Hunters were most commonly sent to seek specific resources, often the hides, bones, fluids, or other parts of the magick infused creatures that roamed the wilds.

Harnessing the powerful abilities of the very monsters that threatened them allowed the ancestors of modern species to not only survive, but begin to thrive. As defenses strengthened, and food production grew both more consistent and more abundant, specialist began to experiment and refine the use of these materials, beginning a cycle of ever increasing technology and magick, each invention growing on the last.

Partnering with Hunters, these earliest scholars quickly formed a symbiotic relationship, the Hunters relying on the Scholars for better weapons and armor, the Scholars relying on the Hunters for access to new materials for research. So the beginnings of The Hunt were formed, ever evolving and growing into the pseudo-government it is today.
