<p>Positioned on the Northeastern coast of the Lake Minkara, Naenasera is often referred to as the “Lakeside Jewel of the North”. The city is primarily home to a large population of Wood Elves, though the Elves do not turn away any who would choose to settle within Naenasera. A small number of Humans, Half-Elves, Gnomes, Halflings, and Dragonborn also call Naenasera home, many of them settling there to begin successful businesses, offering imported craft and trade expertise that enriches the local community.</p>
<p>Naenasera is no stranger to Monster activity, though a series of cleverly designed ‘wood mazes’ which turn Monsters around and send them back into the forest without causing damage or death. However, some inlet roads are necessary, which create natural choke-points which the Woodguard (often simply called The Guard” within Naenasera) protect with their lives. Split into three different divisions, the Shield, Sword, and Arrow, teams are dispatched within the city and immediately outside it to ensure eyes and ears are always present within the limbs of Northern Daso.</p>
<h2>The Woodguard</h2>
<p>The Woodguard are split into three divisions, each serving a specialized function in the protection of the city. Each of the branches of this military focus on specific roles to this end:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Shield - This is the most defensive branch of the Woodguard. As the name would suggest, the Shield stays close to the walls of Naenasera, ensuring that immediate response is available for any threats to Naenasera's immediate proximity. Within the shield, there consist several subsections, including the city guard, the wall guard, and a patrol that spans a perimeter around the city.</li>
  <li>Sword - The sword are the offensive partner to the Shield, often providing fast response to initial defensive action made by a Shield corp. Sword are often the hammer to an anvil and hammer manuever, pinning a monster between a strong defensive force and a targeted killing force, making for quick dispatch.</li>
  <li>Arrow - The scouts of the Woodguard, Arrows are meant to act independently of the Sword and Shield corps, although the information they provide The Woodguard is often utilized by Shield corps to maximize defensive efficiency, and Sword corps to disrupt dangerous incoming threats that would not be diverted by the Woodmaze or a basic Shield defensive operation.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Lake Minkara</h2>
<p>Lake Minkara was named after the original Sylvan name given to the Lagiacrus that inhabit the incredibly large body of water, "Mikaravil". At 65,000 square miles, it is the largest freshwater body on Néeark. Home to a large community of Lagiacrus, and even a small number of River Kraken, Lake Minkara is an ecosystem unto itself.</p>
<h2>The Sober Dwarf</h2>
<p>Inspired by a chance visit to Priodomus by the owner and primary operater, Bliss, this is the 2nd Inn on Néeark to be named “The Sober Dwarf” (with the original Sober Dwarf being built in Steelhold in 327). The architecture is a strange marriage of Dwarven sensibilities and elven artistry, having been grown from grey ash, sung to appear as though carved out of marble.</p>
<p>The Sober Dwarf is known for its hearty Mushroom Ales and botanical liquors distilled from the local flora of Daso. Most recently, a new star dish has taken off, “Fey Toast”, inspired by a recipe provided by a visiting Hunter in the 7th century. This dish utilizes a “batter” made from milk, honey, and a unique mushroom which serves as a substitute for the Egg called for in the original Feywild recipe. Served with a rich berry sauce, this dish has quickly become a popular partner to the “Lion's Mane Breakfast Ale”.</p>
