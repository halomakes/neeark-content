<p>Positioned on the Northeastern coast of the XXXX lake, Naenasera is often referred to as the “Lakeside Jewel of the North”. The city is primarily home to a large population of Wood Elves, though the Elves do not turn away any who would choose to settle within Naenasera. A small number of Humans, Half-Elves, Gnomes, Halflings, and Dragonborn also call Naenasera home, many of them settling there to begin successful businesses, offering imported craft and trade expertise that enriches the local community.</p>
<p>Naenasera is no stranger to Monster activity, though a series of cleverly designed ‘wood mazes’ which turn Monsters around and send them back into the forest without causing damage or death. However, some inlet roads are necessary, which create natural choke-points which the Woodguard (often simply called The Guard” within Naenasera) protect with their lives. Split into three different divisions, the Shield, Sword, and Arrow, teams are dispatched within the city and immediately outside it to ensure eyes and ears are always present within the limbs of Northern Daso.</p>

<h2>The Sober Dwarf</h2>
<p>Inspired by a chance visit to Priodomus by the owner and primary operater, Bliss, this is the 2nd Inn on Néeark to be named “The Sober Dwarf” (with the original Sober Dwarf being built in Steelhold in 327). The architecture is a strange marriage of Dwarven sensibilities and elven artistry, having been grown from grey ash, sung to appear as though carved out of marble.</p>
<p>The Sober Dwarf is known for its hearty Mushroom Ales and botanical liquors distilled from the local flora of Daso. Most recently, a new star dish has taken off, “Fey Toast”, inspired by a recipe provided by a visiting Hunter in the 7th century. This dish utilizes a “batter” made from milk, honey, and a unique mushroom which serves as a substitute for the Egg called for in the original Feywild recipe. Served with a rich berry sauce, this dish has quickly become a popular partner to the “Lion's Mane Breakfast Ale”.</p>
