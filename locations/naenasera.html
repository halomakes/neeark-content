<h1>Naenasera</h1>
<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.</p>
<h2>The Sober Dwarf</h2>
<p>Inspired by a chance visit to Priodomus by the owner and primary operater, Bliss, this is the 2nd Inn on Néeark to be named “The Sober Dwarf” (with the original Sober Dwarf being built in Steelhold in 327). The architecture is a strange marriage of Dwarven sensibilities and elven artistry, having been grown from grey ash, sung to appear as though carved out of marble.</p>
<p>The Sober Dwarf is known for its hearty Mushroom Ales and botanical liquors distilled from the local flora of Daso. Most recently, a new star dish has taken off, “Fey Toast”, inspired by a recipe provided by a visiting Hunter in the 7th century. This dish utilizes a “batter” made from milk, honey, and a unique mushroom which serves as a substitute for the Egg called for in the original Feywild recipe. Served with a rich berry sauce, this dish has quickly become a popular partner to the “Lion's Mane Breakfast Ale”.</p>
