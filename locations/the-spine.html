<h1>The Spine</h1>
<p>The dangers within The Spine are many and varied, with the mines and tunnels being home to a wide variety of creatures, including burrowing monsters, such as the Duramboros, and flying wyverns, such as the Rathian. Some of these creatures are naturally aggressive towards miners, while others simply become territorial and aggressive when their homes are disturbed.</p>
<p>In addition to the dangers of the creatures, the tunnels and mines themselves are not without their own hazards. Collapses are not uncommon, and without proper support structures, the tunnels can be prone to cave-ins. In addition, pockets of poisonous gas can accumulate, leading to suffocation or poisoning.</p>
<p>Despite the dangers, the mines of The Spine remain a valuable resource for the people of NÃ©eark, providing both wealth and materials for their civilization. As such, many brave adventurers are willing to risk the dangers in order to reap the rewards of the mines.</p>
