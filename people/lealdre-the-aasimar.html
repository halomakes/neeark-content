<h1>Lealdre the Aasimar</h1>
<p>No one knows exactly how old Lealdre the Aasimar is, not even herself. She is quoted as having answered once, when asked, “I have lost track of the years while covering the establishment of the Elven Cities on Ineon. I have forgotten to tally the centuries during the meteoric rise of the Hunter's Guild on Priodomus. I cannot being to guess as to my age, but that is not of consequence. I am old enough to have seen first hand the things of which I've written, or at least heard the story recounted first hand.”</p>
