<p>NPCs found here are considered to be “minor”. These NPCs are either not met often enough to garner their own page, or play such small roles their information can be easily fit into a paragraph or two. Where possible, the NPCs are grouped by their home-continent.</p>

<h2>Kyria Pol</h2>
<blockquote>
  <h6>Rose</h6>
  <p><strong>Race:</strong> Human</p>
  <p><strong>Pronouns:</strong> She/Her</p>
  <p><strong>Appearance:</strong> Rose wears long black hair with long fringes in each sides, pale skin and charcoal gray eyes. Her usual outfit is a dark blue high-neck long sleeved leather armor short dress with gold accents. She wears matching thigh-high boots and long gloves.</p>
  <p><strong>Bio: </strong>Rose was once a Hunter within the guild before an injury prevented her continuing in that capacity. Always a hunter with a keen eye for detail and monster's behavioral patterns, Rose was quickly offered the role of handler, working to assign contracts to appropriately skilled hunters in her “on hours” and studying monsters and monster activity reports in her “off hours”.</p>

  <p><strong>Appearance:</strong> A young, handsome elf with deep black hair and piercing green eyes.</p>
  <p><strong>Bio: </strong>Kymil was the captain of the guard until the 23rd of Winterwane, 673, when he was killed by a Nargacuga which had been infected by an at-the-time unknown virus.
