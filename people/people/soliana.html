<h3><a href="/people/vinarth">Vinarth</a></h3>
<p>A wily and cunning Bard of the College of Swords, Vinarth has a knack for getting himself into situations he needs help getting out of. Though he means well, he is often as much of a liability as an asset, but his roguish attitude and endearing optimism make him a friend to most.</p>
