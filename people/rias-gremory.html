<h1>Back story</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My parent didn’t want me to follow in their footsteps. &nbsp;They got out of the life and settled in Cloudcairne to get away from hunting. &nbsp;They (momma, papa, and Uncle Tib) saved the city once, but don’t like to talk about it. &nbsp;Referred to as the Hero Hunters of Cloudcairne by folks outside of the city. &nbsp; They wanted me to live a normal peaceful life. &nbsp;But listening to Uncle Tib tell me their stories… &nbsp;how could I not want the same? &nbsp;On my 17th birthday, Uncle Tib gave me my first long sword. &nbsp;I loved it. &nbsp;He knew I would. &nbsp;You could see momma and papa’s disapproval. &nbsp;</p>
<p>So, after everyone went home and momma and papa were cleaning up, I begged Uncle Tib to train me as a hunter. &nbsp;To talk to momma and papa, convince them to let me go with him. &nbsp;He was already training another girl, and I could train with them. &nbsp;He refused. &nbsp;Said papa would kill him. &nbsp;And momma would do worse. &nbsp;I argued, tried reason, and even tried to play to his ego. &nbsp;It didn’t work. &nbsp;I cried the whole night. &nbsp; &nbsp;For the next 2 weeks I would sneak out at night and practice with my sword. &nbsp;It was a little too heavy for me. &nbsp;But I wouldn’t give up. &nbsp;That’s when he stepped out from the shadows. &nbsp;He had been watching me the whole time. &nbsp;Trying to train myself. &nbsp;Trying to learn. &nbsp;He knew I would never stop. &nbsp;And if I continued on my own, I’d probably hurt myself or worse. &nbsp;He said he saw my potential. &nbsp;That it was in my blood to be a hunter. &nbsp;So, he agreed to finally train me. &nbsp;Every night, after lights out, I would sneak over to his house and train with him and his apprentice Mareen. &nbsp;I was WOUFULLY behind where Mareen was. &nbsp;Never really caught up if you ask me. &nbsp;</p>
<p>After 6 months of training in secret, it finally happened. &nbsp;I was so sore and tired, I forgot to put away my gear, and just passed out in bed. &nbsp;Momma came in to wake me up… &nbsp;there I was in my full hunter gear. &nbsp;She lifted me out of bed with a levitate spell and pulled it all off me. &nbsp;I was stuck. I couldn’t even fight back. &nbsp;I’m not sure if that was from the shock, or the spell. &nbsp;Papa came in, saw momma pulling my gear off. &nbsp;The disappointment in his eyes hurt more than the angry screams and ripping my gear off from momma. &nbsp;He left the room and she screamed at me for defying them. &nbsp;I was so ashamed I just took it. &nbsp;She stripped me naked. &nbsp;Tossed me into my tub. &nbsp;And gave me the longest lecture while she stood there and made me clean myself up. &nbsp;She helped wash my hair and wasn’t nice about it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>When we went downstairs, as soon as I opened the door, I could hear papa and Uncle Tib arguing. &nbsp;He had sent for him as soon as he left my room. &nbsp;There was no question of who was at fault for his daughter being trained as a hunter. &nbsp;I just sat as Tib, and papa yelled at each other. &nbsp;</p>
<p>“Cass, she’s good. &nbsp;Probably better with a sword than you ever were. &nbsp;And her grasp of spells? &nbsp;Well, ok no one is better than your wife, but still, she is good with them. &nbsp;Add in my knowledge of potions, poisons, and elixirs, and she’s a powerhouse! &nbsp;I would have killed to have someone like this on our team back in the day”, Tiberius exclaimed.</p>
<p>“I don’t CARE, Tib. &nbsp;She is MY daughter! &nbsp;Not yours. &nbsp;Mina is furious. &nbsp;And I’m not far behind her myself. &nbsp;We told you no! &nbsp;We don’t want her in the life. &nbsp;And of course, you did what you want. &nbsp;You always do!” said Cassius. &nbsp;</p>
<p>With a crackling of the air, and you could see momma getting ready to blast uncle Tib across the city. &nbsp;</p>
<p>“Whoa easy there, Mina.” eased Tiberius. &nbsp;“Let’s not get rash here.” &nbsp;</p>
<p>“Oh, I’ll give you a rash. &nbsp;One those whores down at the pub won’t come within a 20-foot pole of.” growled Armina. &nbsp;</p>
<p>“Look. &nbsp;I know we’ve had our squabbles before, but this is different. &nbsp;She can make a difference, guys. &nbsp;She’s that good! &nbsp;It’s not getting better out there. &nbsp;Hunters are …” Tiberius was interrupted.</p>
<p>“STOP. &nbsp;Do not say another word. &nbsp;I don’t care about other hunters. &nbsp;I care about my daughter.” Armina strained with a tear rolling down her cheek. &nbsp;</p>
<p>“She’s almost 18. &nbsp;You won’t be able to stop her at that point. &nbsp;Let me continue to train her. &nbsp;Make sure she’ll be safe.” Tiberius pleaded.</p>
<p>I had to speak up. &nbsp;“He’s right. I’ll do this with or without your blessing.” &nbsp;</p>
<p>“Let her show you. &nbsp;Let her prove it. &nbsp;Guys… &nbsp;come on. &nbsp;I wouldn’t bull shit you. She is REALLY good.” Tiberius claimed.</p>
<p>Momma furled her eyebrows. &nbsp;Papa sighed and looked at momma. &nbsp;They locked eyes for what seemed an eternity. &nbsp;Silent words passing between them. &nbsp;For all knew, momma cast a spell and they were talking. &nbsp;Finally, she spun on her heels and walked to their bedroom. &nbsp;She stopped and spoke.</p>
<p>“You have 15 mins to prepare and be in the dojo. &nbsp;I won’t hold back; do you hear me? &nbsp;Let’s see how good you are.” She stated without turning around. &nbsp;</p>
<p>“I hear you.” I said back. &nbsp;My heart beating so fast I felt like I was going to pass out. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Fifteen minutes later, I’m back in my hunter gear. &nbsp;Standing in the Dojo papa built before I was born. &nbsp;Where they used to go to “keep their skills tight”. &nbsp;They haven’t used it much. &nbsp;I looked around the empty courtyard like structure. &nbsp;Huge. &nbsp;At least 30 by 30 meters in size. &nbsp;Targeting dummies. &nbsp;Rope ladders. &nbsp;Six-meter pedestals. &nbsp; The works. &nbsp;Papa spent a lot of time, and money on this place. &nbsp;Always seemed like kind of a waste. &nbsp;I’ve never seen them use it.</p>
<p>In true ranger style, my father was suddenly standing next to me. &nbsp;Facing the same way. &nbsp;I heard or felt nothing. &nbsp;It was a little embarrassing because I jumped a little at the realization I was no longer alone. &nbsp;I wasn’t sure if he noticed it. &nbsp;Then he spoke, and I knew he did.</p>
<p>“You really think you are ready for this, Riri?” he said almost silently, but enough that I could hear it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Riri. &nbsp;His nickname for me since I was little. &nbsp;Momma says it less and less. &nbsp;She’s become a little… up tight in recent years. &nbsp;Worried about “appearances” and how the others in the city see us. &nbsp;Papa has always said momma was a very proud woman. &nbsp;Maybe there is more of her in me than I thought. &nbsp;</p>
<p>“Yes, papa. &nbsp;I do.” I stated as I stepped forward ahead of him. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Again, with no noise, my mother suddenly appeared in front of me. &nbsp;I stared at her for a good three seconds. &nbsp;Then I happened. &nbsp;BOOM! &nbsp;A sudden CRACK echoing through the estate. The calp of thunder made me jump again. &nbsp;I had never seen her use Thunder step before, but I had heard of her using it all the time. &nbsp;Uncle Tib said she was showing off. &nbsp;Papa just said she had a flair for the dramatic. &nbsp;It made the hair on my arm stand on end. &nbsp;If my heart could literally be in my throat, it would be. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I watched as Papa walked over and took his place at her side. &nbsp;A good 10 meters in front of me. &nbsp;Uncle Tib came up behind me. &nbsp;Not as quiet as papa. &nbsp;</p>
<p>“This is your chance kid. &nbsp;Give it everything you’ve got. &nbsp;Because your mother will. She is determined to prove you aren’t meant for this.” &nbsp;</p>
<p>“I don’t know any other way, Uncle.” I smirked, string at my mother and the scowl on her face. &nbsp;</p>
<p>“Are you ready?” she yelled. &nbsp;</p>
<p>“As ever… MOTHER.” &nbsp;I said with a glare. &nbsp;</p>
<p>“Then let us begin.” She flashed back.</p>
<p>Panting. &nbsp;My lungs burn. I am breathing, but I can’t breathe if you know what I mean. &nbsp;My arms and legs ache. &nbsp;Papa on the ground. &nbsp;Knees up. &nbsp;Arms on them. &nbsp;Spits blood to the side. &nbsp;Breathing hard as well. &nbsp;Momma hands on her hips. &nbsp;Facing away. &nbsp;Also breathing hard. &nbsp;She can’t hide it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>“Well?” I gasped. &nbsp;</p>
<p>“You can’t deny it anymore, Mina. &nbsp;She’s a good hunter.” Cassius stated</p>
<p>Momma straightened up and gained her composure. &nbsp;Arms now clasped behind her back. &nbsp;Still not turning around, she turns to look at papa. &nbsp;No words. &nbsp;But the looks between them are unmistakable. &nbsp;Papa finally speaks. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I must have been holding my breath, because as soon as she said, “You may be right.” I let out a gasp that made her spin around. &nbsp;“But you still have a lot to learn young lady.” &nbsp;She bellowed. &nbsp;“And no more sneaking around. &nbsp;Starting tomorrow, you will work out with your father from dawn till lunch to increase your speed and strength.” She exclaimed &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>“Wait, I never agreed to this?!” &nbsp;papa sighed and then winked at me. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Afternoons will be spent with me in my study because your spell work is abysmal. &nbsp;And evenings will be Monster training with Tiberius. &nbsp;Do I make myself clear?” &nbsp;</p>
<p>“Yes, momma.” A smile from ear to ear on my face. &nbsp;</p>
<p>“Tiberius. &nbsp;If …. &nbsp;if at any point she doesn’t look like she will make it on her Graduation Test, you will pull her out personally. &nbsp;I’m not kidding. &nbsp;She is your responsibility in this.” She proclaimed as she stared a hole in his soul. &nbsp;</p>
<p>His entire demeanor changed. &nbsp;He looked her in the eye, stood up straight, and with every fiber of his being becoming serious he said, “You have my word.” and bows to her. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Momma then turns and walks off the platform. &nbsp;I run to papa and tackle him screaming with glee! &nbsp;He laughs a big tummy laugh. &nbsp;I feel him arms wrap around me. &nbsp;He gives me a big hug, but then pulls me away to look at my face.</p>
<p>“You did well, Riri. &nbsp;But you need to focus now. &nbsp;This won’t be easy. I can’t go easy on you. &nbsp;And you know your mother will be extra hard on you. When it comes to Monster hunting, listen to Tiberius. &nbsp;For all his faults, he is one of the best hunters I ever worked with. &nbsp;He will teach you well.” &nbsp;</p>
<p>“I will papa, I promise.” I said. &nbsp;</p>
<p>“Good. &nbsp;Now go get cleaned up. &nbsp;It’s lunch time and I’ve worked up an appetite.” He smiled. &nbsp;</p>
<p>So, I trained. &nbsp;And trained. &nbsp;And trained. &nbsp;That’s how I met Uncle Tib’s apprentice. &nbsp;His official apprentice, Marin Rylee. &nbsp;She was everything I wanted to be in a hunter. &nbsp;Quick. &nbsp;Smart. &nbsp;Strong. &nbsp;And she was gorgeous. Long blonde hair. &nbsp;Tall. &nbsp;Perfect figure. &nbsp;I was in love immediately. &nbsp;I had boyfriends before. &nbsp;And I’ve mess around with other girls before. &nbsp;But I had never officially dated another girl. &nbsp;But now we were adult women of 20. &nbsp;We could make our own choices. &nbsp;And after the Graduation Test (we both passed just fine) we became Partners in more ways than just in hunting. &nbsp;For a while anyway. We spent 4 years together as partners. &nbsp; 3 romantically. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>But we fought a lot. &nbsp;Stupid things. &nbsp;She didn’t like how I would fool guys into giving us things or doing things for us if I showed a little skin. &nbsp;But I figured if they were dumb enough to fall for it. &nbsp;And I didn’t like how controlling she was. &nbsp;Everything had to be done by the book. &nbsp;Blake and white. &nbsp;No grey. &nbsp;Eventually we broke up romantically but stayed hunting partner for a year. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Then… &nbsp;I messed up. &nbsp;Her brother Dorian was in town. &nbsp;We all went out drinking. &nbsp;One thing led to another, and … well. &nbsp;You can imagine. &nbsp;He is just a stunning as she is. &nbsp;She… didn’t like that. &nbsp;Said I was infringing on her personal life. &nbsp;At the time, I didn’t see the problem. &nbsp;We were broken up. &nbsp;He was single and hot. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I see now that what I did was messed up, but she won’t hear it. &nbsp;Won’t ever talk to me when I see her around town. &nbsp;She has gone around telling people I only passed because I slept with the volunteers and got help on the test. &nbsp;Others see me and think I’m lying because “Someone so pretty can’t be a hunter”. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, 2 years later, I’m 26 and a little wiser. &nbsp;I think. &nbsp;So, I’ve made it my mission to put it past me and be the better hunter and person. &nbsp;I will prove I belong here and doing this if it kills me. &nbsp;I will be the best.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
