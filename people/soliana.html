<p>Soliana (Lia) is an elven Warlock in The Hunt.</p>
<h2>Appearance</h2>
<p>Lia is a 4'11" blonde slender Eladrin woman with piercing green eyes and tattoos running down her face and arms. She is stunningly beautiful and vibrant, lighting up whatever room she enters. She comes off as sweet and a little naive, but don't let that fool you. Lia is sharp and witty, with a sweet clear voice that can carry over a room. She always has a slight glow to her, an artifact of her upbringing in the Feywild. She speaks several languages with almost no accent, but her Common is lightly accented with an older style of Sylvan due to her childhood. Lia can change her seasonal aspect at a short rest, which gives her different abilities according to which season she is reflecting. Depending upon the season she's presenting as at the time, she changes coloration slightly. Her familiar, a fey dragon named Skye, also changes color according to Lia's aspect.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Summer Lia: Her default. Lia is lightly tanned, with golden hair and eyes the color of fresh grown grass at noon on a summer's day. She wears golds and greens in this aspect. Skye is the color of a summer sky, clear cerulean blue.</p>
<p>Autumn: Lia is strawberry blonde, with eyes the color of frosted grass in the morning fog. Her skin is pale but not icy. She wears golds and reds and oranges. Skye is red with orange and gold wingtips.</p>
<p>Winter: Lia is ice blonde, with icy pale skin. Her eyes the color of an iced over green lake. She wears silvers and blues. Skye is white with pale blue wingtips</p>
<p>Spring: Lia is light blonde, with blushed pale skin and eyes the color of a meadow after the spring rains. She wears pinks and purples in this aspect. Skye is gold.</p>
<p>Lia always wears her Darkshard Amulet, a greenish gold gem on a gold chain. Her quiver is a beautiful golden leather that is tooled with summer flowers and vines, and a golden wood short bow. The quiver is oddly always empty. Skye tends to stay invisible when out in public or around new people.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Lia was born to two Eladrin parents she does not remember on the summer solstice at high noon. She was adopted at a young age by two high ranking members of the Summer Court in the Feywild. She came to the Material Plane five years ago to learn about the goings on at her father's behest. Lia is trained in the use of long and short bows and swords, as well as daggers. Skye has been with her since as long as she can remember, a gift from her father. They have only recently learned to communicate with each other, and Skye is working on learning to speak Common but prefers to speak telepathically. Lia tries not to say exactly who her parents are to new people, preferring to just say she is from the Summer Court of the Feywild. Currently only Curd and Cal'Rana know, and they are kind enough to keep it to themselves, as they realize it can put Lia in danger after their tangle with the dark elves that stole her blood in a recent skirmish.</p>
<h2>Skills</h2>
<p>Lia speaks several languages: Common, Elvish, Sylvan, Draconic, and Goblin. She is trained in the use of daggers, short and long swords and bows, and is a skilled gardener and alchemist. Her charismatic nature and noble background allow her to blend in amongst the elite in any city, and her courtly manners mean she is an excellent negotiator and ambassador. She can read anything written in any language and create ciphers.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Associates</h2>
<h3>Rinn</h3>
<p>Rinn is a wood elf woman with bright wild red hair braided and dreaded on either side and left wavy and loose in the middle. Her face and arms are heavily tattooed. She has a feral but warm vibe, and prefers to stay in some sort of animal form whenever possible. She and Lia bonded over their shared love of gardening, and when Lia has to travel, Rinn cares for her plants for her in exchange for a portion of whatever harvest they yield or cuttings or seeds from whatever rare plants Lia brings back.</p>
<h3><a href="/people/vinarth">Vinarth</a></h3>
<p>A wily and cunning Bard of the College of Swords, Vinarth has a knack for getting himself into situations he needs help getting out of. Though he means well, he is often as much of a liability as an asset, but his roguish attitude and endearing optimism make him a friend to most.</p>
