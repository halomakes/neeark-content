<h1>Vinarth</h1>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:50%;"><img src="/people/vinarth.jpg"></figure>
<p>A wily and cunning Bard of the College of Swords, Vinarth has a knack for getting himself into situations he needs help getting out of. Though he means well, he is often as much of a liability as an asset, but his roguish attitude and endearing optimism make him a friend to most.</p>
<p>Vinarth dreams of one day becoming as famous a storyteller as <a href="/people/lealdre-the-aasimar">Lealdre the Aasimar</a>. In meeting the Party, he is convinced that they may be able to give him the stories he needs to rise to the annals of history.</p>
