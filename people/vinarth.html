<p>A wily and cunning Bard of the College of Swords, Vinarth has a knack for getting himself into situations he needs help getting out of. Though he means well, he is often as much of a liability as an asset, but his roguish attitude and endearing optimism make him a friend to most.</p>
<p>Vinarth dreams of one day becoming as famous a storyteller as Lealdre the Aasimar. In meeting the Party, he is convinced that they may be able to give him the stories he needs to rise to the annals of history.</p>
