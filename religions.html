<p>Néeark is a world where the gods (as some choose to refer to these powerful beings) play a very strong role in the Material Plane. From the Primary Pantheon, responsible for the creation of Néeark, to the Munravatu worshipped by the Goblins, gods have long had a prominent place among the people.</p>

<h2>The Munravatu</h2>
<p>The Munravatu are a group of gods who were birthed with the planes of Néeark, whose essences are tied to the very nature of the planes themselves. Many of these gods are credited with the creation of many of the sentient species who call Néeark home, including, but not limited to: <a href="/factions/goblin">Goblins</a>, <a href="factions/high-elf#eladrin">Eladrin</a>, and <a href="/factions/kobold">Kobolds</a>.</p>
