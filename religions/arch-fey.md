The Arch-Fey are divided into four courts, each taking the name of a season: Summer, Autumn, Winter, Spring. The Summer and Winter courts serve as the two major powers of the Feywild, with the Autmnal and Spring courts holding some power, but nothing near that of the primary courts. The Four Courts serve as the "governments" of the Feywild, though trying to explain to a Mortal what government in the Feywild is like would be akin to explaining the economy of Néeark to an ant.

The major power in the land, and thus, the court that affects the majority of the Feywild is the Summer Court, ruled over by Titania and her consort, Oberon. Together, the two Archfey have worked diligently to keep the Summer Court in power, and its denizens safe and free. Maintaining the magical ebb and flow of the ley-lines, and preventing bleed-through to the material plane (insomuch as it can be prevented), the Summer Court focuses much of its time keeping the Feywild peaceful and just.

The bitter Winter Court serves as the antithesis to the Summer Court, a cold and biting land, it seeks subjugation and control at all costs. The lands of the Winter Court are in a perpetual state of starless midnight, a single, static Blood Moon casting an eerie red glow over the land. Hags, banshees, feral Drow, and many other dark and cunning creatures call this land home, often searching for areas where the veil between the Feywild and the Material Plane are thinnest, in an effort to exert their control over Mortals as well. Common features of the Winter Court include atmospheric magic such as following a road for a few hours, but ending up back where you were, sudden freezing fog that hides anything inches away, and illusory magics that breed paranoia and distrust amongst wandering parties.

The Autumn Court is a mysterious and elusive court, known for its love of riddles and puzzles. Its ruler, the Archfey Mabon, is said to be a master of riddles and enigmas, and those who seek his aid must be prepared to solve his challenges. The court is often associated with the harvest season, and its members are skilled at agriculture and gardening, as well as brewing and baking. The Autumn Court is known for its delicious feasts, but those who attend must first solve a riddle or puzzle to gain entry.

The Spring Court is a court of rebirth and renewal, led by the Archfey Eostre. It is said that when Eostre wakes from her winter slumber, the snow and ice begin to melt, and new life springs forth from the ground. The court is known for its love of music and dance, and its members are skilled at crafting instruments and creating enchanting melodies. The Spring Court is a place of healing and rejuvenation, and those who seek its aid are often granted new beginnings and fresh starts. However, the court also has a mischievous side, and its members are known for playing pranks and tricks on one another and outsiders alike.

## Oberon
Oberon - Oberon appears as a male fairy of perhaps unusual size (4' 6") with no wings, and is strongly muscled by fey standards. He wears a cloak made of green leaves stitched into brown leather. Oberon is the consort of Titania and a member of her Summer Court. He is the father of Damh and Verenestra. He is called King Oberon, but this is an honorific due to his marriage to Queen Titania; he has little political authority among the Summer Court.

Calm and apparently docile, he shows no outward signs of anger, even when directly insulted or slighted. However, his carefully planned and calculated revenges are commonly known amongst all of the Fey, and very few willingly cross him, save maybe the very brave or the very foolish.

## Titania
Titania - Proud and noble, with a smile, she could ripen a crop, and with a frown, summon wildfires. Titania is the Arch-Fey of Faerie folk, Friendship, and Magic. Her symbol is a white diamond with a blue star glowing in its center, the antithesis of the black diamond symbol of her sister, the Queen of Air and Darkness. Titania is described as a beautiful female faerie, only three and a half feet in height, with gossamer wings, pale skin, and penetrating blue eyes. She often carried a diamond tipped wand.

Titania is the leader of the Summer Court, a large confederation of Arch-Fey, which consists of her consort Oberon, their children Damh and Verenestra, as well as the following Arch-Fey: [list here]. Titania is revered by all non-evil faeries, but brownies, bookas, pixies, and sprites worship her as their special patron. She is most often seen with at least one of her attendants: Peaseblossom, Cobweb, Moth, and Mustardseed, and her young pet human changeling boy.

## Verenestra
Verenestra is the fey deity of female faeries, charm, and beauty. Her symbol is a filigree-edged silver mirror. Verenestra chooses to appear as any demure, slim female faerie of unearthly, fey beauty. She is always barefooted, wearing only gossamer garments the size of handkerchiefs to provide her with a semblance of modesty. She stands four and a half feet in height. Verenestra is the daughter of Titania and one of the Inner Circle of the Summer Court. Verenestra is revered primarily by dryads, nymphs, and sylphs.

## Damh
Damh (pronounced "dahv") is the fey deity of dance, song, and celebrations. His symbol is flutes, pipes, and a drum. Damh appears as a male korred with long, tawny-auburn hair tied into braids. He carries a set of pipes, a wooden flute, and a harp. A physically powerful god, he may ambush hostile invaders into fairy lands. He is a god of the Inner Circle of the Summer Court, Damh is the son of Titania and Oberon.

Damh's main worshipers are korreds, satyrs, and atomies. Titania worries so much about the various sylvan races that Damh felt compelled to take over some of her responsibilities and, therefore, lighten her load.

## The Queen of Air and Darkness
The Queen of Air and Darkness is the fey deity of Magic (especially illusions), Darkness, and Murder. Her long-lost true name is never spoken among the fey. Her unholy symbol is a black diamond. The Queen of Air and Darkness is a bodiless, invisible being, but she can be perceived magically as a wingless faerie with pale, angular features, flowing white hair, and a Golden Crown which covers her eyes and emits a constant blue flame. She is beautiful, but hers is a terrible, eldritch beauty that chills the bone. The Queen is cold and utterly emotionless, save for occasional spells of swift and furious violence.

The Queen of Air and Darkness is the sister of Titania, once a princess and heir to the Winter Court of the FeyWild. The evil Queen, her once bright spirit corrupted and dead, now hates and opposes Titania's Sumer Court and everything they stand for. She rules from a throne of shadows, her court filled with evil, twisted fey, elves, and undead. Hell hounds and yeth hounds slaver at her insubstantial feet. The Queen of Air and Darkness is served by dark sprites, quicklings, evil elves, and bramble faeries, among others. The Queen of Air and Darkness is blamed with the creation of all evil fey races, including quicklings, forlarrens and spriggans.

It is said that no one, not even her sister, remembers the true name of The Queen of Air and Darkness. She has gone to great depths to ensure that no one living remembers her name, ensuring that none in any realm may hold power over her.

## Mabon

Mabon is the ruler of the Autumn Court in the Feywild of Néeark. He is a cunning and enigmatic fey, known for his love of riddles, wordplay, and puzzles. Mabon is often described as a thin, wiry figure, with sharp features and piercing green eyes that seem to hold a hint of mischief and danger.

As the ruler of the Autumn Court, Mabon is responsible for maintaining the balance of power in the Feywild, ensuring that no court becomes too dominant or too weak. He is a skilled negotiator and diplomat, often using his wit and charm to broker peace between feuding factions.

Mabon's court is known for its love of games and challenges, and the Archfey himself is known to issue challenges to other fey and mortals alike. Those who fail to meet his challenges or answer his riddles are often subjected to his mischievous pranks and tricks.

Despite his playful nature, Mabon is a powerful and respected figure in the Feywild. His court is known for its vast knowledge of magic and its skilled artisans, who craft intricate works of art and enchanted objects. Mabon himself is a master of illusion magic and is known to have a particular fondness for creating elaborate illusions to fool and mislead his enemies.

Mabon is often depicted with a staff made of twisted vines and leaves, which he uses to channel his magic. He is also known to wear an intricate cloak made of autumn leaves, which grants him protection from magical attacks.

Overall, Mabon is a complex and intriguing figure, whose love of games and challenges belies his true power and influence in the Feywild.

## Eostre

Eostra is often depicted as a beautiful elven maiden, adorned in a wreath of flowers and carrying a staff of living wood. She is said to possess the power to breathe new life into the world, ushering in the rebirth of nature after the long sleep of winter. Her magic is closely tied to the changing seasons, and it is said that she can manipulate the very flow of time to bring about the blooming of flowers and the growth of crops.

The Spring Court itself is a land of vibrant color and endless possibility. The air is filled with the sweet scent of blooming flowers, and the ground is covered in lush grasses and soft moss. The inhabitants of the Spring Court are often portrayed as carefree and whimsical, with a deep appreciation for the beauty of the natural world. They are masterful gardeners and herbalists, and many of their potions and tinctures are said to have magical healing properties.

Despite her gentle nature, Eostra is not to be trifled with. She is fiercely protective of the natural world and will go to great lengths to prevent any harm from befalling it. Those who seek to exploit or despoil the land of the Feywild will find themselves facing the wrath of Eostra and her loyal followers.

Many adventurers seek out the aid of Eostra and the Spring Court, whether it be to heal their wounds or to gain access to the powerful magic of the Feywild. In return, Eostra often asks for their assistance in protecting the natural world from those who would seek to harm it. Those who prove themselves to be true champions of the natural world may even be granted the gift of Eostra's magic, allowing them to wield the power of nature itself.
