<h2>Tlāloc</h2>
<p>Tlāloc is the supreme god of the rain as well as earthly fertility and water. He is widely worshipped among Goblins as a beneficent giver of life and sustenance. However, he is also feared for his ability to send hail, thunder, and lightning, and for being the lord of the powerful element of water. The cult of Tlaloc is one of the oldest and most universal in Goblin culture.</p>
<p>In Goblin cosmology, the four corners of the Material Plane are marked by "the four Tlalocs" (Classical Goblin: Tlaloke) which both hold up the sky and function as the frame for the passing of time. Within the Codex Goble, the Five Tlaloke are pictured watering maize fields. Each Tlaloc is pictured watering the maize with differing types of rains, of which only one is beneficial. The rain that is beneficial to the land is burnished with jade crystals and represents the type of rain that would make a bountiful harvest. The other forms of rain are depicted as destroyers of crops, “fiery rain, fungus rain, ice rain, and flint blade rain”. This depiction shows the power that Tlaloc has over Goblin crop supply.</p>
<p>Tlaloc holds the most sway over the Material Plane during the Autumnal Equinox, often marking the start of Harvest amongst Goblin-kind. During this time, a single Piplitin child is selected to be brought before the temple of Tlaloc in Tehtikan, the first Goblin City. At this ritual, the child has their heart removed from their chest and placed in a bowl as an offering to Tlaloc. Rather than killing the child, Tlaloc gifts (in a majority of cases) the child with a Sapphire Heart, granting them powerful abilities and incredible strength. The child is then taken and trained to be a Paladin of Tlaloc, the most feared and respected among Goblin War-bands.</p>
<h2>Xōchitl</h2>
<p>Xōchitl is the goddess of flowers, love, beauty, and fertility. She is often depicted as a youthful maiden adorned with a headdress of flowers, and her skin is said to radiate a golden glow. In Goblin culture, Xōchitl is believed to be the bringer of love and is revered as a goddess of fertility who ensures the growth and abundance of crops.</p>
<p>Goblin farmers often pray to Xōchitl to bless their crops and ensure their fertility, and her priests perform ritual dances and offer flowers to honor her. In Goblin art, Xōchitl is often depicted surrounded by fields of flowers, and she is said to create the most beautiful flowers in all of Néeark.</p>
<p>During the Spring Equinox, Xōchitl's power is said to be at its strongest, and Goblin villages hold festivals in her honor, with music, dancing, and flower offerings. It is said that during these festivals, couples who make love in a field of Xōchitl's flowers are blessed with fertility and a happy union.</p>
<p>However, Xōchitl also has a darker side. She is believed to have the power to curse those who break their vows of love or betray their partners. In Goblin folklore, it is said that those who incur Xōchitl's wrath are struck by a withering sickness, their skin turning gray and lifeless like the petals of a dead flower. To avoid her wrath, Goblin couples often make offerings to Xōchitl before entering into a union, and married Goblin couples will offer her flowers as a sign of their continued love and devotion.</p>
