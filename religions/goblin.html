<h2>Tlāloc</h2>
<p>Tlāloc is the supreme god of the rain as well as earthly fertility and water. He is widely worshipped among Goblins as a beneficent giver of life and sustenance. However, he is also feared for his ability to send hail, thunder, and lightning, and for being the lord of the powerful element of water. The cult of Tlaloc is one of the oldest and most universal in Goblin culture.</p>
<p>In Goblin cosmology, the four corners of the Material Plane are marked by "the four Tlalocs" (Classical Goblin: Tlaloke) which both hold up the sky and function as the frame for the passing of time. Within the Codex Goble, the Five Tlaloke are pictured watering maize fields. Each Tlaloc is pictured watering the maize with differing types of rains, of which only one is beneficial. The rain that is beneficial to the land is burnished with jade crystals and represents the type of rain that would make a bountiful harvest. The other forms of rain are depicted as destroyers of crops, “fiery rain, fungus rain, ice rain, and flint blade rain”. This depiction shows the power that Tlaloc has over Goblin crop supply.</p>
<p>Tlaloc holds the most sway over the Material Plane during the Autumnal Equinox, often marking the start of Harvest amongst Goblin-kind. During this time, a single Piplitin child is selected to be brought before the temple of Tlaloc in Tehtikan, the first Goblin City. At this ritual, the child has their heart removed from their chest and placed in a bowl as an offering to Tlaloc. Rather than killing the child, Tlaloc gifts (in a majority of cases) the child with a Sapphire Heart, granting them powerful abilities and incredible strength. The child is then taken and trained to be a Paladin of Tlaloc, the most feared and respected among Goblin War-bands.</p>
<h2>Xōchitl</h2>
<p>Xōchitl is the goddess of flowers, love, beauty, and fertility. She is often depicted as a youthful maiden adorned with a headdress of flowers, and her skin is said to radiate a golden glow. In Goblin culture, Xōchitl is believed to be the bringer of love and is revered as a goddess of fertility who ensures the growth and abundance of crops.</p>
<p>Goblin farmers often pray to Xōchitl to bless their crops and ensure their fertility, and her priests perform ritual dances and offer flowers to honor her. In Goblin art, Xōchitl is often depicted surrounded by fields of flowers, and she is said to create the most beautiful flowers in all of Néeark.</p>
<p>During the Spring Equinox, Xōchitl's power is said to be at its strongest, and Goblin villages hold festivals in her honor, with music, dancing, and flower offerings. It is said that during these festivals, couples who make love in a field of Xōchitl's flowers are blessed with fertility and a happy union.</p>
<p>However, Xōchitl also has a darker side. She is believed to have the power to curse those who break their vows of love or betray their partners. In Goblin folklore, it is said that those who incur Xōchitl's wrath are struck by a withering sickness, their skin turning gray and lifeless like the petals of a dead flower. To avoid her wrath, Goblin couples often make offerings to Xōchitl before entering into a union, and married Goblin couples will offer her flowers as a sign of their continued love and devotion.</p>
<h2>Chanticoatl</h2>
<p>Chanticoatl is the goblin god of trickery, mischief, and deception. He is often depicted as a mischievous and playful goblin with a wide grin and a twinkle in his eye. He is revered by goblins as the patron of thieves and tricksters, and his worship is especially prevalent among goblin communities that exist on the fringes of other societies.</p>
<p>Chanticoatl is said to possess the power of shape-shifting, which he uses to evade capture and trick his enemies. He is often associated with fire, as fire can be both a tool of destruction and a source of warmth and light, much like the nature of his trickery. His worshippers often make offerings to him in the form of small trinkets or stolen goods, and they believe that if they are cunning and clever enough, Chanticoatl will smile upon them and grant them good luck in their future endeavors.</p>
<p>The worship of Chanticoatl is not without its risks, however. Legend has it that those who anger Chanticoatl or fail to honor him properly may find themselves the target of his pranks and tricks, which can range from mild inconveniences to life-threatening situations. Despite this, many goblins view Chanticoatl's worship as a necessary part of their way of life, and his mischievous influence can be seen in many aspects of goblin culture, from their jokes and games to their tactics in battle.</p>
<h2>Nanautzin</h2>
<p>Nanautzin is the Goblin goddess of death, patron of the underworld and keeper of the souls of the departed. She is often depicted as a skeletal figure, draped in a cloak of woven spider silk. Her eyes are empty sockets, and her hair is made of cobwebs. She is said to be accompanied by a pack of skeletal dogs, who hunt down the souls of the wicked and bring them to her for judgment.</p>
<p>In Goblin belief, Nanautzin judges the souls of the dead and decides their fate in the afterlife. She has two attendants, Xolotl and Mictecacihuatl, who assist her in this task. Xolotl is the god of lightning, who guides the souls of the worthy to the afterlife, while Mictecacihuatl is the goddess of death and rebirth, who oversees the reincarnation of souls.</p>
<p>Nanautzin is often worshipped in conjunction with other Goblin deities, particularly Tlāloc and Huitzilopochtli. She is sometimes depicted as a fearsome deity, who must be appeased with offerings of human sacrifices to ensure that she is not angered and that the souls of the dead are judged fairly.</p>
<p>Goblins often hold elaborate rituals to honor Nanautzin, particularly during the Day of the Dead festival, which is celebrated in ever Goblin village. During this time, Goblins offer gifts of food, drink, and flowers to their departed loved ones, as well as to Nanautzin and her attendants. They also perform dances and sing songs to celebrate the cycle of life, death, and rebirth.</p>
<h2>Xolotl</h2>
<p>Xolotl is one of the most revered gods in Goblin culture, particularly among warriors and those who value honor and bravery. He is associated with the element of lightning and is often depicted wielding a jagged lightning bolt as a weapon. In Goblin mythology, Xolotl is said to have been born from the union of two other gods, and he is considered to be the brother of Tlaloc, the supreme god of rain and fertility.</p>
<p>As the god of lightning, Xolotl is believed to be able to strike down enemies with bolts of lightning and to protect Goblin warriors in battle. He is also associated with guiding the souls of the worthy to the afterlife, and is often depicted leading the souls of the fallen to the Goblin underworld.</p>
<p>Xolotl is often portrayed as a fierce and powerful god, with a muscular build and jagged, lightning-like features. He is typically depicted with a fearsome expression, and often wears a helmet adorned with feathers or animal features. In some depictions, he is shown with wings or talons, further emphasizing his status as a powerful deity.</p>
<p>Xolotl is honored in Goblin culture through regular offerings of food and drink, as well as through elaborate festivals and ceremonies. Warriors often invoke his name before battle, asking for his protection and guidance in the heat of combat. In the afterlife, it is said that those who have lived a life of valor and honor are greeted by Xolotl and taken to their eternal rest in his realm.</p>
<h2>Mictecacihuatl</h2>
<p>Mictecacihuatl is a powerful Goblin deity who holds sway over the cycle of life, death, and rebirth. She is often depicted as a skeletal figure adorned in jewelry made from bones, and is accompanied by owls and bats, which are seen as omens of death and rebirth in Goblin culture.</p>
<p>As the goddess of death and rebirth, Mictecacihuatl is responsible for guiding the souls of the dead through the underworld and overseeing their reincarnation. She is known for her strict judgement of souls, weighing their deeds in life against the weight of their heart, and determining their ultimate fate.</p>
<p>In Goblin mythology, it is believed that souls are reincarnated based on their deeds in their previous life. Those who lived a life of honor and virtue are reborn into a higher station, while those who were wicked or dishonorable are reborn into lower stations, or even as animals or plants.</p>
<p>Mictecacihuatl is also closely associated with the Day of the Dead, a major Goblin holiday where the living honor and remember their ancestors who have passed on. During this holiday, offerings of food, drink, and other items are left for the deceased, and it is believed that the veil between the living and the dead is thinnest, allowing for communication between the two realms.</p>
