## Tlāloc
Tlāloc is the supreme god of the rain as well as earthly fertility and water. He is widely worshipped among Goblins as a beneficent giver of life and sustenance. However, he is also feared for his ability to send hail, thunder, and lightning, and for being the lord of the powerful element of water. The cult of Tlaloc is one of the oldest and most universal in Goblin culture.

In Goblin cosmology, the four corners of the Material Plane are marked by "the four Tlalocs" (Classical Goblin: Tlaloke) which both hold up the sky and function as the frame for the passing of time. Within the Codex Goble, the Five Tlaloke are pictured watering maize fields. Each Tlaloc is pictured watering the maize with differing types of rains, of which only one is beneficial. The rain that is beneficial to the land is burnished with jade crystals and represents the type of rain that would make a bountiful harvest. The other forms of rain are depicted as destroyers of crops, “fiery rain, fungus rain, ice rain, and flint blade rain”. This depiction shows the power that Tlaloc has over Goblin crop supply.

Tlaloc holds the most sway over the Material Plane during the Autumnal Equinox, often marking the start of Harvest amongst Goblin-kind. During this time, a single Piplitin child is selected to be brought before the temple of Tlaloc in Tehtikan, the first Goblin City. At this ritual, the child has their heart removed from their chest and placed in a bowl as an offering to Tlaloc. Rather than killing the child, Tlaloc gifts (in a majority of cases) the child with a Sapphire Heart, granting them powerful abilities and incredible strength. The child is then taken and trained to be a Paladin of Tlaloc, the most feared and respected among Goblin War-bands.
