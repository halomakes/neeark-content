<p>Kobold Religion is focused around a singular deity, Tiamat, who is said to have created five demi-gods, all in the form of powerful Kobolds. These five demi-gods form the cults of Kobold culture. While Tiamat is universally worshipped as the one-true god of Kobolds, several cults exist which also exonerate their chosen demi-god.</p>
<h2>Tiamat</h2>
<p>Tiamat is worshipped as the kobold deity of creation and the queen of the dragons. Kobolds see her as a great and powerful dragon who embodies the primal forces of chaos and creation. She is often depicted as a massive dragon with five heads, each one representing a different element: earth, air, fire, water, and void.</p>
<p>As a creator deity, Tiamat is responsible for the formation of the kobold race and their world. According to kobold legend, Tiamat was the one who breathed life into the first kobold, and since then, they have worshipped her as their protector and provider. Kobolds believe that Tiamat's power flows through the earth, the air, the fire, and the water, and that she watches over them from her domain in the heavens.</p>
<p>Tiamat is also revered as the queen of the dragons, and some kobold clans worship her alongside other dragon gods. In these legends, Tiamat is said to have created the first dragons from the primordial elements, and she is often depicted with dragon-like features herself.</p>
<p>Despite her status as a deity of creation, Tiamat is also known for her destructive power. Some kobolds believe that her chaotic energy can manifest in storms, earthquakes, and other natural disasters. However, they also see these events as necessary for the rebirth and renewal of the world, and so they continue to revere Tiamat as a powerful and benevolent goddess.</p>
<h2>Kurtulmak, the Kobold demi-god of traps, mining, and war.</h2>
<p>Kurtulmak is worshipped by many kobold cults as a cunning and resourceful demi-god who teaches them how to trap and mine the earth for resources. He is often depicted as a small, wily kobold with sharp eyes and quick hands, armed with a variety of traps and weapons. Kobolds believe that Kurtulmak's teachings are essential for their survival in the dangerous underground tunnels and caverns where they make their homes.</p>
<p>In addition to his role as a teacher of traps and mining, Kurtulmak is also worshipped as a demi-god of war. Kobold legends tell of him leading his followers into battle against larger, stronger foes, using their knowledge of traps and ambushes to even the odds. Some cults even believe that Kurtulmak is capable of granting his followers divine powers during times of war or crisis.</p>
<p>Despite his cunning and martial prowess, Kurtulmak is not a universally beloved demi-god among the kobolds. Some see his teachings as overly cautious or overly aggressive, and some even believe that he is responsible for bringing war and violence into their lives. Nonetheless, he remains an important figure in many kobold pantheons and is often invoked in times of need.</p>
<h2>Dakarnok, the deity of craftsmanship, creation, and invention.</h2>
<p>Kobolds view Dakarnok as the patron of their craftsmen and builders, and they believe that he imbues them with the knowledge and skill to create their intricate traps, tools, and weapons. In many kobold communities, his followers are responsible for crafting the most important items and structures, including the clan's shrine to Tiamat.</p>
<p>Dakarnok is often depicted as a burly, muscular kobold with a thick beard and calloused hands. Kobolds believe that he was the one who taught their ancestors how to shape and mold metal, and that he continues to guide their craftsmen to this day. Some cults also revere him as a deity of invention and innovation, believing that he inspires their best minds to create new devices and machines.</p>
<p>While Dakarnok is primarily associated with craftsmanship and creation, he is also worshipped as a protector and defender of kobold communities. Some legends tell of him creating mighty weapons and suits of armor to help his followers defend themselves against their enemies. Others believe that he has the power to imbue his creations with divine energy, making them stronger and more resilient.</p>
<p>Despite his importance to many kobold cults, Dakarnok is not without his detractors. Some kobolds see him as a symbol of stagnation and tradition, arguing that his focus on craftsmanship and invention distracts from the more pressing needs of survival and expansion. Nonetheless, he remains a beloved and respected figure in many kobold communities, and his followers continue to create some of the most impressive and intricate works of art and engineering in the known world.</p>
<h2>Kobold demi-god of protection, loyalty, and war.</h2>
<p>Nomog-Geaya is a revered figure in many Kobold clans, seen as the protector of Kobold homes and the embodiment of loyalty to the tribe. He is often depicted as a sturdy and stalwart Kobold, wearing armor and wielding a shield and sword. Kobold legends tell of Nomog-Geaya's unwavering devotion to his people, leading them to victory in times of war and defending their homes against outside threats.</p>
<p>As a deity of protection, Nomog-Geaya is also associated with fortifications and defenses. Many Kobold clans build elaborate traps and fortifications in honor of Nomog-Geaya, seeing them as both practical and symbolic defenses against harm. Some even believe that the demi-god himself imbues these structures with divine protection, making them even more effective.</p>
<p>Nomog-Geaya is also revered for his martial prowess, and some Kobold cults believe that he is capable of granting his followers enhanced combat abilities during times of need. However, he is not a deity of war in the same way as Kurtulmak, and his emphasis is more on defense and protection rather than aggressive tactics.</p>
<p>Overall, Nomog-Geaya is a beloved figure in Kobold religion, seen as a defender of the tribe and a paragon of loyalty and devotion.</p>
<h2>Vaprak, the god of strength, earthquakes, and destruction.</h2>
<p>Vaprak is worshipped by some kobold clans as a powerful and fearsome deity who embodies the raw, destructive power of nature. He is often depicted as a massive, muscular kobold with rippling muscles and a fierce countenance, wielding a mighty hammer or mace. Some legends say that Vaprak's footsteps can cause earthquakes and that his roar can cause mountains to crumble.</p>
<p>As a god of strength, Vaprak is revered by many kobolds for his ability to grant physical power and endurance to his followers. Kobold warriors often invoke his name before going into battle, believing that he will give them the strength to overcome their enemies. He is also seen as a patron of laborers and builders, as his power is said to make it easier to move heavy objects and dig through solid rock.</p>
<p>Despite his destructive tendencies, Vaprak is not seen as an evil deity by his followers. Instead, he is seen as a necessary force of nature, much like earthquakes and other natural disasters. Some kobolds even believe that he has a role to play in the cycle of creation and destruction that governs the world.</p>
<p>Overall, Vaprak is a complex and powerful deity in the Kobold pantheon, worshipped for his ability to grant strength and endurance to his followers, as well as his destructive power.</p>
<h2>Kethryllia, the Kobold demi-goddess of magic, knowledge, and trickery.</h2>
<p>Kethryllia is worshipped by a small but devoted cult of kobolds who seek to unlock the secrets of magic and knowledge hidden in the depths of the earth. She is depicted as a lithe and cunning kobold, with a sharp mind and a quick wit. Kobold legends tell of her outsmarting powerful enemies with her cleverness and cunning, using her knowledge of magic to turn the tide of battles and outmaneuver her foes.</p>
<p>In addition to her mastery of magic and trickery, Kethryllia is also revered as a demi-goddess of knowledge. Kobolds who seek to learn the secrets of the world and the mysteries of the arcane often turn to her for guidance and wisdom. Some cults even believe that Kethryllia has the power to grant her followers glimpses of the future or insights into the workings of the universe.</p>
<p>Kethryllia is not without her detractors, however. Some kobolds view her as a dangerous and unpredictable demi-goddess, whose thirst for knowledge and power can lead her followers down dangerous paths. Nonetheless, her followers remain devoted to her, seeking to unlock the secrets of the world and use their knowledge to gain an advantage in the dangerous underground caverns where they make their homes.<br>&nbsp;</p>
