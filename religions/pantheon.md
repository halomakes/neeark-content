### The Creation of Néeark
When all was black, and the void reigned supreme, Vehn-Ahrii, the Goddess of Gods desired to be challenged, yearning for a way to put her skills to use, to feel pain, to feel triumph, to feel anything. Though Powerful, she held little sway in the Void, unable to create within its confines without the blessings of the Lord of the Void, Ihnanis. She presented herself to Ihnanis, imploring him to grant her the powers and permissions to create for herself a Grand Hunt, where she would be free to create mighty creatures that she might spend her days hunting these creatures or creating new creatures to hunt.

Ihnanis, who had long lusted after Vehn-Ahrii, countered with a deal: Marry him, and in return, he would create for her an infinite expanse where she could hunt to her heart's content. Ihnanis pontificated on his love for Vehn-Ahrii, speaking of her grace, her beauty, and her vibrance. Vehn-Ahrii's heart, however, belonged to another, and she rejected Ihnanis, stating that if he truly loved her, he would grant her even just a small area to call her own, and allow her to be happy.

Angered and hurt by this rebuff, Ihnanis lashed out, striking Vehn-Ahrii, accusing her of attempting to take advantage of him, and vowing that she would never hunt, so long as he ruled. Hurt and afraid, Vehn-Ahrii went to Mesmors, Goddess of Death and the Harvest, telling her of Ihnanis' anger and violence. Together with Mesmors' sister, Khasi, they worked together to create Néeark, a hiding place where they might slip away, sheltered from the rage of Ihnanis.
