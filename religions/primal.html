<p>The Primals are powerful entities that were created shortly after the formation of NÃ©eark, each one tied to a specific element and ruling over its own elemental plane. They are considered to be among the most ancient and powerful beings in the universe, possessing incredible magic and knowledge.</p>
<p>There are six Primals in total, each reflecting their respective element in their appearance and abilities.</p>
<h2>Fyrae</h2>

<p>This primal embodies the element of fire, appearing as a flickering, ever-shifting blaze. Her form is constantly changing, flickering between humanoid and bestial shapes, with tendrils of flame extending from its body. Her eyes glow a bright red, and her voice crackles with heat and power. Those who stand too close to her risk being burned or consumed by her inferno.</p>
<h2>Aquanis</h2>

<p>This primal embodies the element of water, appearing as a shimmering, fluid entity. Their body is translucent and constantly moving, rippling like waves, shifting between masculine and feminine forms over time. Their voice is like a gentle stream, but it can also roar like a raging river when angered. Aquanis can shape water at will, and its mere presence can cause rain, floods, or even create new bodies of water.</p>
<h2>Terrax</h2>

<p>This primal embodies the element of earth, appearing as a towering, stony figure. Its body is made of living rock, and it moves with a ponderous grace. Terrax's voice is like the rumble of an earthquake, and its gaze can cause the ground to shake. It can control stone and earth, creating mountains, earthquakes, or even burying its enemies alive.</p>
<h2>Aeris</h2>
<p>This primal embodies the element of air, appearing as a whirling vortex of wind and clouds. Its form is ever-changing, shifting from a gentle breeze to a fierce tornado. Its voice is like the howl of a hurricane, and it can summon gales, storms, and lightning at will. Aeris can also fly, and those who try to attack it with melee weapons risk being knocked back or thrown off their feet by its winds.</p>
<h2>Zorath, the Radiant</h2>
<p>Zorath is the Primal of Light, a being of blinding radiance and celestial fire. Its body is made up of golden flames that constantly shift and flicker, emitting a brilliant light that can be seen for miles. Its eyes are orbs of pure white light that gaze upon the world with a piercing intensity. Zorath's domain is the plane of Radiance, a realm of endless light and warmth where everything is illuminated and nothing can hide.</p>
<h2>Nethra, the Shadowed</h2>
<p>Nethra is the Primal of Darkness, a being of inky blackness and chilling cold. Its body is made up of swirling shadows that seem to move of their own accord, coalescing and dissipating in a never-ending dance. Its eyes are pits of darkness that suck in all light and leave nothing behind. Nethra's domain is the plane of Shadows, a realm of eternal night and creeping darkness where nothing is as it seems and everything is shrouded in mystery.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each of the Primals is incredibly powerful, possessing control over their respective elements and the ability to manipulate reality itself. They are revered by many cultures as gods or deities, but their true nature and intentions are shrouded in mystery.</p>
