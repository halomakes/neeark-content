<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>This page is meant to be an “Invite Only” page to help me keep track of all the bullshit I'm making up but don't want the players to see. Seriously, please don't spoil yourself if you somehow found your way here. I'll try to fill with some random bullshit before getting to spoiler territory, but if you scroll down that's on you.</p>
<p>I will also work to keep the Headings as Spoiler-free as possible.</p>

<h2>First Steps</h2>
<p>First season was a bit of a mix, trying to get a feel for the world. Some canon was established, and the basic mechanics used throughout the campaign were introduced.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the second season, while keeping the next chapter in the minds of the players, I aim to get everyone used to things again, after the sabbatical, including the improvements I've introduced to the campaign. Things start off with an investigation into a proto-Elder Dragon that's been causing a bunch of shit, allowing for a few callbacks to the original campaign to solidify the canon.</p>
