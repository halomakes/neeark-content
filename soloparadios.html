<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>This page is meant to be an “Invite Only” page to help me keep track of all the bullshit I'm making up but don't want the players to see. Seriously, please don't spoil yourself if you somehow found your way here. I'll try to fill with some random bullshit before getting to spoiler territory, but if you scroll down that's on you.</p>
<p>I will also work to keep the Headings as Spoiler-free as possible.</p>
