<h1>First Steps</h1>
<p>During the first season, a few things were established. Growing pains were had, and we figured out a few things:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Curd is the party's official mascot. This was decided at some point between the 0th and 1st session.</li>
  <li>Players who want to hog the spotlight don't work well with this group.</li>
  <li>Aaron needs to get better at updating the wiki when he creates shit so that he doesn't fuck up later on.</li>
  <li>Aaron needs to get better at updating the wiki when he creates shit so that he doesn't fuck up later on.</li>
  <li>Yes, that was the same point twice, but really, Aaron needs to get better at updating the Wiki so… you get it.</li>
</ul>
<p>We established the premise of a world on the cusp of an industrial revolution, with many beginning to finally live without the fear of a Monster attack ending their lives or at least their livelihood. These monsters are infused with energy above and beyond that normally tapped into by mages and other magically inclined folks within Néeark. This makes them both dangerous, and a vital resource for the technological development of the sentient species.</p>
<p>These creatures have not only ensure a constant external pressure, ensuring an odd peace between the sentient species, who have never known a war, due to being in a constant state of survival. This is beginning to change, however, as those at the highest positions of power forget the horrors of death and destruction, instead seeking to consolidate as much power as possible, hoarding wealth that would make a red dragon green.</p>
<p>During this time, a few key adventures were had…</p>
<h2>Introduction to Nyloth</h2>
<p><a href="/people/nyloth">Nyloth</a> was the player's first introduction to the idea a Hunter is not always noble, and it's possible for a Hunter to fall out with The Guild, including excommunication. He is performing experiments on Monsters, attempting to control them in their natural state as living weapons. His experiments at this stage are inconclusive and destructive, causing the peoples of <a href="/locations/steelhold">Steelhold</a> to take out a contract to defend themselves against the monsters set loose by his experimentations.</p>
<p>The party accepted this contract, bringing them into direct conflict with Nyloth, who immediately declared himself the hero of the story, and announced how his work would save Néeark. He disappeared after summoning Demons, fleeing the continent to find a new foothold on Ineon, better hidden from the near omniscient gaze that The Guild holds over Priodomus.</p>
