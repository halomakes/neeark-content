<h2>Session Prep</h2>
<p>During the prior session, the party was introduced to the concept of a new force corrupting monsters to make them more aggressive. Meeting <a href="/people/misc-npcs#lias-duskpool">Lias</a>, the party was told of a recent string of attacks by hyper-aggressive monsters. The party was told that the recent attacks killed several locals, including <a href="/people/misc-npcs#kymil-willowwind">Kymil</a>, the previous captain of the guard.</p>
<p>Lias will provide the crew with a detailed rundown of events thus far:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"During the last several weeks, Monster attacks have claimed the lives of 16 elves. The previous captain of the guard, Kymil, was among those lost. We have increased our patrol three-fold with the assistance of volunteers, and have near-daily attacks at this point.</p>
  <p>Nargacuga prowl the edges of the forest, snatching elves on their way to visit family.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
