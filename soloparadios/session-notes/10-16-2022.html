<h2>Session Prep</h2>
<p>During the prior session, the party was introduced to the concept of a new force corrupting monsters to make them more aggressive. Meeting <a href="/people/misc-npcs#lias-duskpool">Lias</a>, the party was told of a recent string of attacks by hyper-aggressive monsters. The party was told that the recent attacks killed several locals, including <a href="/people/misc-npcs#kymil-willowwind">Kymil</a>, the previous captain of the guard.</p>
<p>Lias will provide the crew with a detailed rundown of events thus far:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"During the last several weeks, Monster attacks have claimed the lives of 16 elves. The previous captain of the guard, Kymil, was among those lost. We have increased our patrol three-fold with the assistance of volunteers, and have near-daily attacks at this point.</p>
  <p>Nargacuga prowl the edges of the forest, snatching elves on their way to visit family.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Encounter Details</h4>
<h6>Fey Riddles</h6>
<p>PCs encounter a fey creature who challenges them with a simple riddle. Answering the riddle correctly will result in a small boon and no further action taken. Rolling incorrectly will result in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/d100/comments/8hxmlj/lets_build_fey_pranks/">curse</a>. Refusing the riddle will also result in a curse.</p>
<h6>Lit Candle</h6>
<p>PCs come around to a single, lit candle. If they put out the flame by any means, magical darkness devours 300 ft. radius around the now unlit candle. A pair of <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17010-shadow">shadow</a> materializes out of the smoke, attacking the party. If the candle is lit, the shadow, and the darkness disappear. The shadow won't pursue the party out of the darkness covered area.</p>
<h6>Sunny Meadow</h6>
<p>720 ft (220 meter) area, appears to be sunlit meadow. DC 15 perception check, to notice it's way more bright then it should be. At the center of the area is a chest, holding a Rare magical item. Anybody who enters, or ends their turn in the area suffers 1d6 radiant damage. (The only time double damage is taken is on initially entering the area.)</p>
<h6>Time Loop Forest Grove</h6>
<p>Every 6 seconds trees grow, fall, decompose, repeat. If a tree lands on someone, grows under someone, or just hits someone with a branch then they take the appropriate damage.</p>
