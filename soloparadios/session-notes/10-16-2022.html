<h2>Session Prep</h2>
<p>During the prior session, the party was introduced to the concept of a new force corrupting monsters to make them more aggressive. Meeting <a href="/people/misc-npcs#lias-duskpool">Lias</a>, the party was told of a recent string of attacks by hyper-aggressive monsters. The party was told that the recent attacks killed several locals, including <a href="/people/misc-npcs#kymil-willowwind">Kymil</a>, the previous captain of the guard.</p>
