<h1>Session Prep</h1>
<p>During the prior sessions, the party was introduced to the concept of a new force corrupting monsters to make them more aggressive. Meeting <a href="/people/misc-npcs#lias-duskpool">Lias</a>, the party was told of a recent string of attacks by hyper-aggressive monsters. The party was told that the recent attacks killed several locals, including <a href="/people/misc-npcs#kymil-willowwind">Kymil</a>, the previous captain of the guard.</p>
<p>Lias will provide the crew with a detailed rundown of events thus far after introducing the current captain of the guard, <a href="/people/misc-npcs#venali-roseshade">Vanali</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"During the last several weeks, Monster attacks have claimed the lives of no less than two dozen elves. The previous captain of the guard, Kymil, was among those lost. We have increased our patrol three-fold with the assistance of volunteers, and have near-daily attacks at this point.</p>
  <p>Nargacuga prowl the edges of the forest, snatching elves on their way to visit family. Anjanath have burned homes and families-"</p>
  <p>At this point, Venali will interrupt,<sup>[1]</sup></p>
  <p>“Suffice it to say, losses have been heavy, and time is of the essence. What we know thus far is that Monsters in the area appear to be losing their sense of self-preservation. Species that normally would not approach us throw themselves against our spears and blades, taking many of our own with them. This is not typical Monster behavior, this is something new.</p>
  <p>The Arrow corps have identified no fewer than a half-dozen Monsters under the effects of this blight, the Woodmaze does little to slow their attacks. Entire sections have been destroyed as the Monsters barrel through Meter thick trunks with a blood-lust the likes of which we have never seen. As Lias stated, the Shield has doubled in strength in the last month, bolstered by much-needed volunteers. The Sword are stretched thin, with some attacks never seeing a sword maneuver, relying entirely on the Shield corp for defensive action. This has slowed our response to Monster incursions, which are increasing in pace.</p>
  <p>We need you to find the source of these behavioral changes, and either report back to us so we can deal with it, or, if possible, deal with it yourselves. We have can offer 40 Platinum for a report with the source of the changes, or 100 Platinum for elimination of the source with evidence."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Before officially signing the contract, Venali will ask to see the Hunter's coins, proving their affiliation. PCs may also use this opportunity to ask for leads. Venali knows the following information:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="/people/misc-npcs#azariah-fernhollow">Azariah Fernhollow</a>, who oversees the Arrow corp may have some information for the party.</li>
  <li><a href="/people/misc-npcs#ilyrana-timberpool">Ilyrana Timberpool</a> runs a family business fishing on Lake Minkara. They barely survived an attack from an incredibly aggressive Lagiacrus that wandered inland.</li>
  <li>The Monsters mostly seem to come from the North of the city.</li>
  <li>All of the Monsters exhibit similar symptoms:<ul>
      <li>discoloration of the skin, fur, feathers, or hide, resulting in a dark purple hue all over the body (later stages)</li>
      <li>the monster's eyes will become a bright red, often blackened around the socket</li>
      <li>the monster will begin to huff a dark purple smoke from its mouth as it exhales</li>
      <li>monsters exhibit massively heightened aggression, speed, and strength</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Every day, there is an ever-rising chance of an attack on the city again. Starting with a d20, roll a dice at the end of each day, lowering the ‘size’ of the dice each day until an attack occurs, then resetting the sequence. On a roll of 1, frenzied monsters will attack the city, with civilians likely in danger. The lowest possible chance is a d4 for this. This puts a “ticking clock” component into play, with the constant risk of attack looming, but without disrupting the investigation too much.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Day 1, d20 roll = 15, no attack</li>
  <li>Day 2, d12 roll = 4, no attack</li>
  <li>Day 3, d8 roll = 1, attack</li>
  <li>Day 4, d20 roll</li>
</ol>
<p><sub>1. Venali speaks with a soft confidence. She is not reprimanding Lias, rather, she would prefer to give the PCs the facts so they can get to work investigating. Venali is soft-spoken, but confident. She sticks to the facts she knows, often providing very little in the way of commentary or supposition. If she says something, there's a good chance she can back it up.</sub></p>
<h2>The Investigation</h2>
<p>The players will need to track down Gore Magala, utilizing clues to determine the Monster's den's location. Once located, the players will have a chance to prepare before attacking or otherwise luring the Gore Magala. The Guard will contact the players when a rampage is seen heading towards a civilian population, giving the party time to get back to the town to help defend. If the party chooses not to return, the town guard will perform based on the table below. Roll a d20 and compare:<br>&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="table">
  <table>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Roll</strong></td>

      <tr>
        <td>1</td>

<p>The party will need to acquire “tracking points” via successful interactions. Several potential sources of these points lie scattered around the city, ranging from social interactions to extract information, undertaking tracking operations offered by the Arrow, successfully defending the city against a Monster attack, or clearing out enraged Monsters for the Sword.</p>
<p>After a sufficient number of pts are acquired, the Gore-Magala will appear after a particularly brutal attack, fighting until it is reduced to half-strength and running.</p>
<h3>Tracking Pt Sources</h3>
<ul>
  <li>After each fight with a Frenzied Monster, the party will gain pts toward locating the lair. [20 pts]</li>
  <li><a href="/people/misc-npcs#azariah-fernhollow">Azariah Fernhollow</a> will offer the players scouting missions to various areas, either asking the party to locate a missing team, recover intel on Monster movements, or otherwise assist the Arrows with ongoing operations.<ul>
      <li>If the right questions are asked, Azariah will realize that only 1 of the Monster attacks has failed to come from the North or East of the city. This concentrates the search and allows the Shield to focus their efforts on the NE quadrant of the city, making for more effective defense. [10 pts] [+1 modifier to NPC run city-defense]</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="/people/misc-npcs#ilyrana-timberpool">Ilyrana Timberpool</a> lost one of their boats on Lake Minkara. The boat has a crew of a half-dozen, and Ilyrana would see them returned. This crew has seen Gore Magala making regular passes across the lake. [50 pts]<ul>
      <li>Ilyrana can also provide the characters with a first-hand account of the attack. If the characters ask about the Lagiacrus attack, they will be provided with a story of the attack they suffered. The symptoms are confirmed to be the blight which has been affecting the Monsters in the area, providing the party a clue that the source is not limited to the forests immediately around Daso [10 pts]</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The Shield will call the players via a Message spell when the city is attacked. Assisting the Shield in the Defense will assign a +10 modifier to the normal Frenzied Monster pts gain.</li>
  <li>The Sword can sent the players on missions to attack Frenzied Monsters who are reported by the Arrows to be B-lining towards the city. This also applies a +10 modifier to the normal Frenzied Monster pts gain.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Azariah Fernhollow</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Ilyrana Timberpool</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Gore Magala</h3>
<p>Gore Magala is residing in a cave on the Northern coast of Lake Minkara, and is corrupting the Monsters around its lair with the spores on the hair it sheds while hunting.</p>
<h2>Potential Encounters around Naenasera</h2>

<h3>Encounter Details</h3>
<h4>Fey Riddles</h4>
<p>PCs encounter a fey creature who challenges them with a simple riddle. Answering the riddle correctly will result in a small boon and no further action taken. Rolling incorrectly will result in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/d100/comments/8hxmlj/lets_build_fey_pranks/">curse</a>. Refusing the riddle will also result in a curse.</p>
<h4>Lit Candle</h4>
<p>PCs come around to a single, lit candle. If they put out the flame by any means, magical darkness devours 300 ft. radius around the now unlit candle. A pair of <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17010-shadow">shadow</a> materializes out of the smoke, attacking the party. If the candle is lit, the shadow, and the darkness disappear. The shadow won't pursue the party out of the darkness covered area.</p>
<h4>Sunny Meadow</h4>
<p>720 ft (220 meter) area, appears to be sunlit meadow. DC 15 perception check, to notice it's way more bright then it should be. At the center of the area is a chest, holding a Rare magical item. Anybody who enters, or ends their turn in the area suffers 1d6 radiant damage. (The only time double damage is taken is on initially entering the area.)</p>
<h4>Time Loop Forest Grove</h4>
<p>Every 6 seconds trees grow, fall, decompose, repeat. If a tree lands on someone, grows under someone, or just hits someone with a branch then they take the appropriate damage.</p>
